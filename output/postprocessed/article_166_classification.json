  "Article_Title": "Enhancing educational and vocational recovery in adolescents and young adults with early psychosis through Supported Employment and Education (SEEearly): study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial",
  "Abstract": "BackgroundPsychotic disorders often develop a chronic course with devastating consequences for individuals, families, and societies. Early intervention programs for people in the first 5 years after the initial psychotic episode (early psychosis) can significantly improve the outcome and are therefore strongly recommended in national and international guidelines. However, most early intervention programs still focus on improving symptoms and relapse prevention, rather than targeting educational and vocational recovery. The aim of the present study is to explore the effects of Supported Employment and Education (SEE) following the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model in people with early psychosis.MethodsThe SEEearly trial compares treatment as usual (TAU) plus SEE to TAU alone in outpatient psychiatric settings. The study is a six-site, two-arm, single-blinded, superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants are randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention or control group. Aiming to recruit 184 participants, with an assumed drop-out rate of 22%, we will be able to detect a 24% difference in the main outcome of employment/education with 90% power. We make assessments at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Outcome data on employment/education, medication, and current psychiatric treatment is obtained monthly through phone based short assessments. The primary outcome is steady participation for at least 50% of the 12-month follow-up in competitive employment and/or mainstream education. Secondary employment outcomes capture length of employment/education, time to first employment/education, monthly wages/educational attainment, and social return on investment (SROI). Secondary non-employment outcomes include subjective quality of life, psychopathology, substance use, relapse, hospitalization, and functional impairment. To be eligible, participants must be between 16 and 35 years, fulfill diagnostic criteria for early psychosis, and be interested in competitive employment and/or mainstream education.DiscussionIn SEEearly, we hypothesize that participants with psychosis, who receive TAU plus SEE, present with better primary and secondary outcomes than participants, who receive TAU alone. Positive results of this study will justify SEE as an evidence-based strategy for clinical routine treatment in people with early psychosis.",
