  "Article_Title": "Expanding Individual Placement and Support to Populations With Conditions and Disorders Other Than Serious Mental Illness",
  "Abstract": "Objective: A systematic review of studies of individual placement and support (IPS) for populations other than those with serious mental illness was conducted.Methods: The authors searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) for studies of IPS and modified IPS. Eligibility criteria for the systematic review included randomized controlled trials with prospective data collection on competitive employment rate and at least 10 study participants from a well-defined population other than people with serious mental illness. Results were compiled for competitive employment rates, IPS fidelity, and other outcomes.Results: Three clinical groups other than people with serious mental illness have been studied: people with psychiatric disorders other than serious mental illness, people with substance use disorders, and people with musculoskeletal or neurological disorders. Nine controlled trials with a total of 2,902 participants included six trials with people who had psychiatric disorders other than serious mental illness, two with people who had substance use disorders, and one with people who had spinal cord injuries. In eight studies, results for competitive employment rates significantly favored IPS. Meta-analysis yielded an overall weighted odds ratio of 2.23 (95% confidence interval=1.53-3.24, p<.001). Findings for other employment outcomes also favored IPS, but findings on symptom reduction and quality of life were inconsistent. The strongest (and only replicated) findings were for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methodological limitations included small samples, major modifications to IPS fidelity, and short follow-up periods.Conclusions: IPS, often with modifications, is a promising employment intervention for several populations in addition to people with serious mental illnesses. The strongest evidence pertains to veterans with PTSD. IPS should be offered to these veterans. Research on other populations, including people with anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, musculoskeletal or neurological conditions, or pain syndromes, needs development, amplification, and replication.",
