  "Abstract": "The present study investigates the effects of cognitive remediation (CR) training with Individual Placement and Support (IPS) in people suffering from severe mental illness in European population (Spanish). Sixty-five participants (83% with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) were recruited from community mental health teams. Fifty-seven met the criteria and agreed to participate in the study. The conditions of cognitive rehabilitation were assigned randomly with support employment CR + IPS (n = 28) and IPS alone (n = 29). Two groups were followed at 8 and 12 months after the baseline. Participants in the CR + IPS group improved more than the IPS only group during the follow-up period in measures of cognitive functioning (significantly higher in executive functions, verbal learning and memory) and obtained higher employment percentages during the follow-up period, including people who got a job after 8 months (52.2% versus 29.2%, p = .023) and after 1 year (60.9% versus 37.5%, p = .025), as well as, in the weekly hours worked (37.2 versus 26.7 h, p = .023). Retention in the CR + IPS program was high (82.14%). The calculated global cognitive score showed that the evolution over time differed significantly between groups (p < .001).",
