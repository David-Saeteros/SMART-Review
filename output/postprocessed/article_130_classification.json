  "Article_Title": "Efficacy of a peer-led group program for unemployed people with mental health problems: Pilot randomized controlled trial",
  "Abstract": "Background: People with long-term unemployment and mental health problems often find it difficult to take active steps toward help-seeking and job search and to navigate the complex system of available services. Likewise, job center staff would welcome interventions to improve the reintegration of long-term unemployed individuals with mental health problems into the labor market.Aim: To examine the efficacy of a peer-led group program that supports unemployed people with mental health problems in terms of help-seeking, job search and recovery.Methods: Based on participatory research, a four-session group program was designed and evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 42 participants, randomized to the program (n=23) or treatment as usual (n=19). Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0), 3weeks (T1), 6weeks (T2) and 6months later (T3).Results: There were no significant intervention effects on primary outcomes (job search self-efficacy and help-seeking). But compared to the control group, intervention participants showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (p=.02) and recovery (p=.04) at T2 with medium effect sizes. There were trend-level positive program effects on self-stigma, hopelessness and secrecy.Conclusion: This pilot RCT provides initial evidence for the efficacy of a peer-led group program to improve symptoms and recovery among unemployed participants with mental health problems.",
