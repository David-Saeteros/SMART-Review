  "Abstract": "Background: While effective vocational methods for gaining employment exist for people with schizophrenic and similar conditions, no evidence exists with regard to people with affective disorders. We aimed to study the( effectiveness of a newly developed Individual Enabling and Support (IES) model adapted for the target grout and compared to traditional vocational rehabilitation (TVR).Methods: An assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel design was performed. Sixty-one participants received IES or TVR. The primary outcome was employment rate at 12-month follow-up. Secondary vocational outcomes, depression severity, and quality of life were also studied. Trial register number is ISRCTN93470551.Results: IES was more effective for employment compared to TVR (42.4% vs. 4%; difference 38%, 95% C 0.12-0.55). Significant group differences were present in secondary vocational outcomes (hours and week employed, time to employment), and depression severity. The IES-group had significantly lowering in depression scores and increased quality of life scores during the intervention period.Limitations: This RCT was limited by the small sample size due to restriction of recruitment to middle-sizes cities within geographically diverse sites in southern Sweden. Larger trials are needed, also in primary health care and employment services settings.Conclusions: IES is more effective than TVR for attaining employment and improving depressive symptoms. On a societal level, IES closes the time and service gap between treatment and employment, and thus lower: sick-leave costs.",
