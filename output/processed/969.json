    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of autistic young adults aged 18 to 25 years old over a 12-month transition period from 2016 to 2017. Data was collected through a longitudinal repeated measures case series design with assessments conducted at 2 time points, at baseline then 12 months later. Assessments included self-report evaluations of transition planning and intervention received at high school, engagement in post-secondary education and access to employment, living circumstances, and social support. Examination of 9 cases showed family and social support was an important facilitator of successful transition whilst low independence was a risk factor associated with unsuccessful transition. In-depth analysis of cases showed a lack of engagement in post-secondary education and unemployment were associated with poor quality of life whilst skills development, work experience placements, and support from service providers were associated with improved quality of life. Implications of the findings highlight the need for educational and socially inclusive interventions to support the heterogeneity in individual, social, communication, and behavioural challenges in autistic young adults.",
