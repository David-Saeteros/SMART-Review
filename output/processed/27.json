    "Abstract": "People with disabilities (PwDs) are under-represented in the workforce, especially during times of economic recession. Supported employment is recognized as an effective practice for promoting work inclusion of PwDs, including people with intellectual disabilities (IDs). This study aimed at exploring the experiences of workers with ID or mental health conditions who received supported employment services in Greece. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine workers with ID and five with mental health conditions. The thematic analysis revealed that emotional pressure was experienced by the participants with mental health conditions and those with ID during the job search and the adaptation period, respectively. On-the-job training was available for the participants with ID and assistance in finding suitable job opportunities was given to those with mental health conditions. All participants highlighted the importance of maintaining employment. The findings can inform efforts on developing employment services targeting social and work inclusion for PwDs.",
