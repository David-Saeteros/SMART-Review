    "Article Title": "Translating Phenomenology of Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures Into Nosology Insights From Patients' and Caregivers' Profiles",
    "Abstract": "Background: Patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) can be semiologically dichotomized into those with hyperkinetic and those with paucikinetic events. The objective of this study was to compare characteristics of patients with diverse phenomenology and their caregivers to evaluate for differences that could inform about disease nosology. Methods: Patients and caregivers monitored at the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit completed surveys about sociodemographic and disease characteristics, treatment and health care utilization, physical and psychosocial impact, and epilepsy knowledge. Patients were classified into hyperkinetic versus paucikinetic based on their recorded events. Comparison of the 2 populations was performed using Student t test for continuous variables and Fischer exact test for categorical variables. Results: Forty-three patients with Epilepsy Monitoring Unit confirmed PNES and 28 caregivers were enrolled. Patients with hyperkinetic events were more commonly non-White patients and necessitated greater caregiving time. Otherwise, no statistically significant differences were seen between the 2 semiologically diverse groups of patients and caregivers in their sociodemographic (age, sex, employment, income, marital, and education) and disease (age of onset, duration, seizures frequency) characteristics, treatment (number of antiseizure medications before diagnosis, side effects) and health care utilization (emergency room visits, hospitalizations, clinic visits), physical (injuries) and psychosocial (depression, anxiety, quality of life, stigma, burden) characteristics, nor in their knowledge about seizures. Conclusions: Hyperkinetic events were more frequently encountered in non-White patients and required more caregiving time. Further research is required to elucidate if phenomenological dichotomy of PNES can inform about their nosological basis, and if it can guide treatment and define prognosis.",
