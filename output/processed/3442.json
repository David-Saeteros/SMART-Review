    "Article Title": "Depressive Symptoms and Blood Pressure in African American Women A Secondary Analysis From the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure Study",
    "Abstract": "Background Depression is a risk factor for hypertension, yet few studies have been conducted in African American women. Objective We conducted a secondary analysis of depressive symptoms and high blood pressure among African American women from the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure longitudinal study (N = 250). Methods Logistic regression was used to examine depressive symptoms and blood pressure, adjusting for education, employment, and racism/discrimination. Growth curve modeling was used to investigate longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures at 4 time points (T1-T4). Results Depressive symptoms at baseline were not prospectively associated with hypertension prevalence. Participants with Beck Depression Inventory scores higher than 10 had higher estimated marginal SBP and DBP over time compared with participants with lower scores. Conclusion Depressive symptoms were not associated with hypertension prevalence at T4, but they were associated with higher estimated marginal SBP and DBP. Future research is needed to elucidate mechanisms and implications for clinical care and prevention.",
