    "Abstract": "College students today suffer more than ever from depressive symptoms. This web-based survey collected both subjective self-reported and objectively measured mobile screen time from smartphones' screen time reporting feature from 426 and 175 college students, respectively. Depressive symptoms were measured by the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, age, employment, first-generation student status, sexual orientation, social support, and social ladder. Compared to those with 3.05 or fewer hours of objectively measured daily mobile screen time, those with 3.10-5.68 hr did not have increased odds of depressive symptoms, while those with more than 5.72 hr had significantly higher odds, (OR: 3.49, 95% CI: 1.24-9.86). Restricted cubic spline of the association between objectively measured daily mobile screen time and depressive symptoms further confirms the threshold effect-the probability of depressive symptoms holds relatively steady until about 5 hr of daily mobile screen time and then shows a sharp rise. Findings suggest a nonlinear relationship between mobile screen time and depressive symptoms which, despite a moderate positive correlation between self-reported and objectively measured average daily mobile screen time (r = .51, p < .001), has not be captured using self-reported mobile screen time. Future studies should objectively measure mobile screen time and college students at risk for depressive symptoms should consider limiting their mobile screen time to about 5 hr per day.",
