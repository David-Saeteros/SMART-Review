    "Abstract": "Objective: Rural unpaid caregivers experience different opportunities and challenges than their urban counterparts. Our aim was to understand rural unpaid caregivers' experiences of challenges and opportunities during the Covid-19 pandemic in New Zealand. Setting: Rural northern New Zealand during the Covid-19 pandemic. ParticipantsA convenience sample of 10 unpaid rural caregivers, most supporting an older person living with dementia. Design: A qualitative descriptive design. Data included interviews and online workshops, and a thematic analysis. Results: Rural unpaid caregivers observed that some aspects of living in a rural context were helpful during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, tasks such as shopping and long-distance travel and communication (both telephonic and digital) became more complex. Abrupt changes to routine and closure of resources and support groups created challenges. Unpaid caregivers worried about what would happen if they were hospitalised themselves. There was a diversity of experience both across caregivers, of familiar routines and rural context as resources, increased challenges requiring resourcefulness to adapt, and experiences of crisis. Many experienced all three states at different times. Conclusion: This research provides valuable insights into challenges and opportunities experienced by rural unpaid caregivers during the Covid-19 pandemic and may help policy-makers and healthcare professionals develop improved emergency preparedness. Multilevel, multisector responses are needed to ensure effective health and social support and access to resources including health care, access to groceries and medication, transport, and communications (telephone and digital). Enhancing rural access to effective and inexpensive online services is particularly important, as is recognition of the value of rural sites or hubs of connection and social interaction.",
