    "Article Title": "Exploring the Views of Mothers of Children Diagnosed with Developmental Disabilities: A Qualitative Investigation into Social Participation and Support Perceptions in T\u00fcrkiye",
    "Abstract": "In Turkiye, care for children with disabilities is performed predominantly by mothers, but they lack support from social services and close family, which exacerbates their challenges. This study examines social participation, social relations and perceptions of social support of mothers of children with developmental disabilities (MCDDs) from a social work perspective. A qualitative research method was used to understand MCDDs' needs. The research population consisted of ten mothers living in Beyoglu, a district of Istanbul. The data were obtained through semistructured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews. The themes were determined and explored using descriptive analysis. The study revealed that MCDDs bear the responsibility for their children's care with limited support from close family members. As a result, MCDDs face severe social isolation and mental health issues and have uncertain futures due to the inability to work or attend school. Moving forward, the situation of MCDDs requires intervention at the micro-, mezzo- and macrolevels to improve the overall well-being of mothers. The social work profession should intervene and assist mothers in accessing needed programmes and services.We conducted a qualitative research study to understand the attitudes of mothers of children with developmental disabilities (MCDDs) towards social support systems and the issues they experience on a daily basis. We recruited and interviewed ten mothers in Istanbul, Turkiye. Our findings reveal that mothers face a wide range of difficulties, such as mental health issues, social isolation and limited support from close family members and the Turkish government. Most importantly, they are deprived of employment and education opportunities. Our findings have crucial implications for research, policy and practice in social work. In recent years, Turkiye has begun investing in new social programmes and services. We hope that our findings help policymakers understand the short- and long-term challenges and ensure that upcoming programmes meet MCDD's unique needs. The social work profession in Turkiye has a crucial role in advocating and providing services to ease mothers' difficulties. Interventions need to be at all levels to ensure that the holistic needs of MCDD are met.",
