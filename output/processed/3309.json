    "Abstract": "In the Job Demand-Control-Support (JDCS) model, the combination of job demands, job control, and social support was hypothesized to lead to eight different constellations of job types. According to the model, these constellations are linked to wellbeing/health and learning outcomes. In the last three decades, these constellations of job types have been investigated by adopting a variable-centered perspective. However, latent profile analyses (LPA) enable a person-centered approach and empirically capture constellations of job types. In the present study, we used LPA to empirically identify distinct profiles of JDCS among Italian healthcare workers. Furthermore, we investigated the role of social stressors (workplace relationships and coworkers' incivility) as antecedents of these profiles and the association of these profiles with job burnout and work motivation. Results from LPA (n = 1671) revealed four profiles: Isolated Prisoner, Participatory Leader, Moderate Strain, and Low Strain. Negative relationships at work and coworkers' incivility increased the chances of being included in both Isolated prisoner and Participatory Leader profiles. Finally, the Isolated Prisoner and Moderate Strain profiles showed the highest levels of emotional exhaustion and cynicism and the lower levels of intrinsic work motivation. This study extends previous JDCS research, highlighting that researchers should consider empirically identified profiles rather than theoretically defined subgroups. Implications for stress theory, future research, and practice are discussed.",
