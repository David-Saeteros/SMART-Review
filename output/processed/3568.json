    "Abstract": "This article examines the feasibility of a complex intervention designed to facilitate the transition of youth out of homelessness. It is intended to contribute to efforts to build out the youth homelessness intervention literature, winch is underdeveloped relative to descriptive characterizations of risk. The 6-month intervention examined here, refened to as the Housing Outreach Program Collaboration (HOP-C), is comprised of transitional outreach-basal case management, individual and group mental health supports, and peer support. The intervention was delivered through a multiagency, interdisciplinary collaboration. Feasibility was assessed using a mixed methods design that included prepost intervention metrics and the study site was a large Canadian urban center. A total of 31 youth participated in the study with 28 completing the intervention. Overall, implementation and youth engagement was successful though patterns and intensity of engagement were quite variable. While prepost, self-report metrics unproved modestly, substantial gains were observed in employment, education, and mental health service connectedness. Qualitative themes focused on the benefits of a flexible, multicomponent approach, close attention to seamless delivery and common factors, and supporting youth in the balance of isolation versus independence. These findings suggested that this tertiary prevention approach is feasible and warrants further investigation.Public Policy Relevance StatementThere is very little evidence regarding the types of services and collaborations that are necessary to support youth in transition out of homelessness. This article describes an example of a multiservice intervention that can inform growing policy-level Mons to replace crisis-oriental care systems with prevention-oriented systems. Fostering collaborations between service sectors is a priority of policy makers in many contexts and is a requirement for effa:tive service delivery for homeless, transition aged youth.
