    "Abstract": "Disasters can lead to decreased functionality in medical practice. This study aimed to quantitatively measure presenteeism and to determine the role of coping strategies among disaster-victim doctors living in a city affected by the 2023-Turkey earthquakes. This cross-sectional study included 220 doctors reached through social media groups using the convenience sampling method. A weak negative relationship was found between presenteeism and positive re-evaluation, one of the coping strategies with earthquake stress. A weak negative correlation was found between the Positive Reappraisal sub-dimension score of the Coping with Earthquake Stress Scale (CESS) and presenteeism (r = -0.299, p < 0.001). In the linear regression analysis, the sub-dimensions that contributed significantly to the model were found to be the Positive Reappraisal sub-dimensions of CESS, whose increase resulted in a decrease in presenteeism and Seeking Social Support sub-dimension, whose increase caused an increase in presenteeism. Presenteeism was higher in those who lost their loved ones, had damage in their workplace/home, and thought they were helpless or in danger. Both material and emotional factors decreased functionality at work after an earthquake. We recommend developing material and psychological support strategies to reduce presenteeism in post-disaster periods.",
