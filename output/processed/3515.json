    "Abstract": "Background: Stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 global pandemic created unprecedented challenges for workers whose work was transferred to the home setting. Little is presently known about the benefits and the challenges associated with global remote work on well-being and mental health, work-life balance, job satisfaction, productivity, home office adaptability, and gender equality.Methods: A scoping review of PubMed/Medline was undertaken in October 2021 to better understand these broad dimensions associated with remote worker health, well-being, and the home office workspace. The review focused on white-collar workers who undertook remote work during each of the lockdown waves from March 2020 to 2021.Results: A total of 62 studies were included in the review, which spanned Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. Overall, workers seemed to enjoy remote work, but productivity varied. The main setbacks associated with remote work included feelings of isolation and loneliness, which negatively influenced well-being. Social support from management and contact with colleagues mitigated this. Leadership style also influenced remote worker well-being. Overall, women suffered from lower levels of remote work well-being and productivity, especially if they had children. The home office and its adaptability were integral for successful remote work. Work-life balance was affected in some workers who struggled with heavier workloads or family duties.Conclusions: To promote well-being and successful remote work, isolation and loneliness should be reduced through greater contact with colleagues and managers. Managers should promote family friendly policies that may support work-life balance and reduce gender inequities in remote work.What is already known about the topic Remote work increased during the pandemic as a result of isolation measures and new working-from-home policies. Remote work introduced new challenges and benefits. Research on the workplace environment and health has shown that work can impact health and well-being.What this study adds This research presents the unique challenges and benefits that were identified with working remotely. This review addresses health and well-being issues that are specific to remote work, beyond simply exploring the physical work office.How might this study affect research and policy? The review makes recommendations that could influence organizational working relationships and working-from-home policies. These include recommendations for promoting psychological well-being during remote work such as reducing isolation and loneliness. It also includes recommendations on organizational leadership and management approaches. It makes recommendations for the home office space.",
