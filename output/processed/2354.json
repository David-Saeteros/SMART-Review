    "Article Title": "The indignities of working with racialization: physical, emotional and familial tolls of experiencing workplace racism",
    "Abstract": "Canada is often viewed as an oasis of multicultural inclusion where racially diverse groups could freely enjoy life in all its forms. Focusing on a group of twenty-five racialized participants working for the public sector in British Columbia (BC), this qualitative study illustrates that workplace racism is alive and prevalent in Canada. Moreover, it aims to demonstrate that this form of racism impacts not only racialized individuals who are targeted, physically and emotionally, but also their families. After presenting an outline of what constitutes racism and racialization, the article will detail and discuss findings with respect to physical, psycho-emotional and familial tolls that experiencing racial discrimination at work had exacted on racialized participants. The paper will then conclude that considering the higher expectations from public servants for not only modeling equity behavior but also upholding the rule of law, opportunities exist to more seriously address systemic racist violence against racialized workers in public sector employment contexts.",
