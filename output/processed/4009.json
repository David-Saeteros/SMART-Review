    "Abstract": "Introduction The International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) aims to improve the quality of life in children with lower urinary tract dysfunction. A substantial portion of children also have problems with bowel dysfunction. There is a lack of evidence-based in-formation on managing neurogenic bowel dysfunc-tion (NBD) in children. Objective/methods The ICCS aimed to provide an up-to-date, selective, non-systematic review of NBD's definitions, assess-ment, and treatment. Background Neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD), often characterized by constipation and/or fecal incontinence, is common in children with various neurologic disorders [1]. Approxi-mately 80% of individuals with spina bifida (SB) and spinal cord injury experience NBD [2,3]. Secondary health concerns from NBD include urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, reversible ventriculoperitoneal shunt mal-function caused by constipation, skin break-down from fecal incontinence, hemorrhoids, and anal fissures [4-6]. NBD has been associ-ated with increased rates of depression, increased bullying, decreased school atten-dance, decreased self-esteem, lower educa-tional attainment, and lower rates of employment [6-8]. A community survey of individuals with SB and their care partners highlighted the importance of NBD manage-ment across all age groups [9]. NBD is managed by various healthcare providers, including physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses from various specialties, including urology, rehabilitation medicine, develop-mental pediatrics, and gastroenterology [10]. The type of provider and type of specialty may Results Specific definitions and terminology are defined within the document. Recommendations and con-siderations for physical assessment, history taking, and diagnostic studies are made. Management up-dates, both surgical and non-surgical, are provided as well as recommendations for follow-up and monitoring of individuals with NBD. Conclusion This review of the current literature will help guide NBD management and research to improve NBD care. vary dependent on the country and healthcare system.
