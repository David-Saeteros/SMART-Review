    "Abstract": "Introduction Diagnoses related to common mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, adjustment disorders and stress-related disorders are one of the leading causes of long-term sick leave for both women and men in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. To increase the rate of return-to-work workplace involvement in a coordinated return-to-work process has been included in recent best practice guidelines. This form of cooperation is a complex process, involving political structures and a wide range of stakeholders. The study's first aim is to describe facilitators and barriers to the coordination of return-to-work from the perspectives of: (A) employees on sick leave due to common mental disorders, (B) employers, (C) rehabilitation coordinators, (D) physicians and (E) other stakeholders. The second aim is to identify ethical issues that arise in the coordination of return-to-work and analyse how these can be resolved.Methods and analysis The study has a qualitative design using interviews with employees on sick leave due to common mental disorders, employers, rehabilitation coordinators, physicians and other stakeholders. The study is conducted in the Swedish primary healthcare. Employees, employers and rehabilitation coordinators are recruited via primary healthcare centres. Rehabilitation coordinators receive information about the study and those who consent to participation are asked to recruit employees and employers. Interview guides have been developed from the consolidated framework for implementation research and ethical values and norms found in Swedish healthcare, social services and workplace legislation. Data will be analysed with qualitative content analysis reflecting manifest and latent content, and ethical issues will be analysed by means of reflective equilibrium methodology.Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden (Reg.no 2018/677-31/2 and 2018/2119-32). The findings will be disseminated through publication in scientific journals, social media, seminars and national and international conferences.",
