    "Abstract": "Background: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are the most impairing psychiatric disorders and are a major cause of social exclusion.Aims: The purpose of this work is to review the literature on social and family support, as well as rehabilitation interventions available for SSD patients, particularly regarding the Portuguese reality. Methods: A literature research was conducted on PubMed of relevant articles regarding this subject.Results and Conclusions: The published literature on this subject highlights the de pendence of SSD patients on their family's support. Lack of labour market integration, economic dependence and difficulty establishing stable relationships further aggravate their social exclusion. There is evidence supporting the need for more investment in psychosocial rehabilitation.",
