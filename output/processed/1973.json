    "Abstract": "Introduction: Youth with intellectual disabilities are severely marginalized in accessing employment. South African policies recognize this group as a priority in youth development efforts, but employment research focuses mainly on adults with disabilities. A lack of understanding about the employment endeavours of youth with intellectual disabilities leads to a shortfall in focused employment strategies and could perpetuate occupational injustices for this group. Aim: To explore how a South African work transition program for youth with intellectual disabilities promotes occupational justice through work. Methodology: Critical ethnography and a critical occupational perspective were used to highlight the socio-political context of the program and structural influences on opportunity in work for youth with intellectual disabilities. Eight in-depth interviews were conducted with program directors, a job coach, and an employer, plus five focus group interviews with employed and unemployed youth respectively. Available program documents were reviewed, and reflective journaling was done on observations during interviews. Content analysis of reviewed documents and thematic analysis of interview transcripts were completed. Manifestations of occupational justice were considered in all program aspects. Findings: The individualized support tenet of 'supported employment' promoted youth with intellectual disabilities' uptake of occupational opportunities and sustained participation in work as meaningful occupation. Support was offered by different role players and premised on the program's human rights foundation in recognition of a concern for contextual barriers, such as policy shortfalls that constrain employment participation and perpetuate occupational injustices for youth with intellectual disabilities.",
