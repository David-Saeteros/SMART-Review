    "Article Title": "Access to mental health support services in Accountable Care Organizations: A national survey",
    "Abstract": "Patients with serious mental illness often lack access to mental health support services. Whether new payment models facilitate access to these services is unknown. We conducted a national survey of accountable care organizations(ACOs) and find that fewer than 50% of ACOs surveyed reported that they have the ability to offer or refer patients to supported employment, family psychoeducation, assertive community treatment and illness, management and recovery services. These findings suggest that even among organizations that are early adopters of payment and delivery reforms - those most likely to lead innovations in population health - access to these services is limited.",
