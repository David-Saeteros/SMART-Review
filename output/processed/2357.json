    "Article Title": "Mental health recovery for people with schizophrenia in Southeast Asia: A systematic review",
    "Abstract": "Accessible Summary What is Known on the Subject? Mental health recovery has become a more prevalent approach to empowering people with schizophrenia (PWS), especially in western countries. However, despite the benefits, there is a lack of evidence regarding its practice in developing countries such as Southeast Asian Countries. The optimal treatment for PWS has not yet been identified, since most mental health care is provided in hospital-based settings in Southeast Asia. Mental health treatment in Southeast Asia is highly influenced by cultural norms, values, and practices. What the Paper Adds to Existing Knowledge? The findings highlight the importance of integrating cultural aspects into the treatment of people with schizophrenia. The sample of unique elements in Southeast Asian mental health recovery include using a close neighbour/cadre as social support and using religious activity to increase hope. Lack of government support, high level of employment, and stigma are the biggest barriers in the PWS recovery process. What is the Implication for Practice? There is a research gap regarding the awareness and implementation of mental health recovery in psychiatric programs across the Southeast Asian region which likely impacts the effectiveness of the treatment. The review shows that little research has explored the concept of personal recovery in Southeast Asian Countries. IntroductionRecovery has become an important approach used by mental health services around the world. Many mental health systems have taken steps to move towards more recovery-oriented practices and service delivery. Therefore, establishing recovery-oriented services in developing countries like those in the Southeast Asian region requires a detailed understanding of the cultural norms, values, and current mental health practices. AimsTo investigate the mental health practices that promote recovery, its barrier in Southeast Asia, and to determine if they align with the CHIME recovery model. MethodElectronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and SCOPUS, were searched [PROSPERO] (CRD42021227962). Peer-reviewed English language articles from 2004 to January 2021 were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the CASP checklist, and thematic synthesis of included studies was conducted. ResultsThirty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Several themes illustrated mental health recovery services and the current obstacles identified in South-east Asian studies. Connection includes peer support and support groups, relationship status, and limited opportunities to become involved in the community. Hope is found in cultural concepts of hope, stimulating recovery through mental health programs, whilst lack of knowledge and education are the main barriers. Ethnicity is linked to a high level of stigma, but ethnicity also builds identity. Meaning and spirituality manifest in religious activities as the catalyst for recovery. Finally, the opposite of Empowerment is seen in the tendency of people with schizophrenia to remain in a passive position. Further barriers to empowerment are unemployment and a lack of social support. DiscussionIn Southeast Asia, the elements of culture, religiosity, and communality are essential to mental health recovery. The obstacles to recovery are relate to human rights, social support, family involvement, and continuity of care.Implications for PracticeThis review explores the concept of mental health recovery for people who are experiencing psychosis and living in Southeast Asian countries. The evidence may contribute to the further development of mental health programs in this region.",
