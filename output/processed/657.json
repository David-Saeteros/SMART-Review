    "Abstract": "Background: Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with substantial socioeconomic burden associated with poorer psychosocial functioning during the course of illness. In schizophrenia patients, multiple factors play a role in occupational functioning.Aim: It was aimed to investigate the relationship between different working conditions and quality of life and self-esteem on patients with schizophrenia in Turkey.Methods: A total of 100 patients diagnosed as schizophrenic were divided into three groups: competitive working, supported working and unemployed.Results: The groups did not differ significantly with regard to psychotic symptoms, self-esteem and illness history. Working was associated with higher scores on quality of life subscales especially in supported working group, whereas unemployed patients had more depressive symptoms and autonomic drug side effects.Conclusion: Structured working programs which may improve social life of patients with schizophrenia in many aspects is warranted in Turkey.",
