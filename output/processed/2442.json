    "Article Title": "Unemployment From the Perspective of the Psychology of Working",
    "Abstract": "Unemployment is a ubiquitous problem that is a complex of cultural, economic interpersonal, physical, and psychological dimensions. Whereas the pernicious negative outcomes of unemployment are empirically established in the literature, there is a need to better understand the psychological experiences of unemployment so as to inform interventions that ameliorate its impact. The present research is based on archival interview data and uses the psychology of working theory to understand 32 individuals' experiences of unemployment. The findings include themes that are consistent with the hypothesized predictors posited in the theory, including marginalization, economic constraints, volition, career adaptability, proactive personality, critical consciousness, social support, and economic conditions. The research findings affirm the conceptual precepts of the theory with regard to its predictors; thus, this contribution to the literature on the psychology of working and unemployment opens new perspectives on a perennial problem.",
