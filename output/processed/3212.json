    "Abstract": "Objective : This study examined the relationship between resilience, self-efficacy, anxiety, and depression to test whether self-efficacy affected anxiety and depression and compared how the participants in different age groups experienced anxiety, as well as the differences in anxiety between employed and unemployed participants. Method : A cross-sectional web-based survey study that included adults aged 60 years or older living in Puerto Rico was performed during April and May 2020. Results : A total of 299 older adults completed the online questionnaire (14% men, 83.6% women). Of the total sample, 25.4% reported having moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, while 20.8% reported having moderate to severe symptoms of depression. Our path analysis model suggested that while self- efficacy did not directly affect anxiety, it had an impact on resilience, thereby reducing anxiety symptoms. The participants who were 71 years old or older had lower anxiety levels than their younger counterparts did. We also confirmed that work might serve as a protective factor against anxiety. Conclusion : Our findings underscore the importance of resilience, self-efficacy, and working later in life to promote well-being and successful aging.",
