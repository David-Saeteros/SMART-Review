    "Article Title": "Social Determinants of Poor Management of Type 2 Diabetes Among the Insured",
    "Abstract": "Purpose of Review Even with insurance coverage increasing over time among the population with diabetes, a large proportion continues to have poorly controlled disease. The purpose of this narrative literature review is to describe the social determinants of poor management of type 2 diabetes among the insured population and illustrate drivers of poor outcomes beyond insurance coverage. Recent Findings Despite the provision of health insurance, social determinants play a significant role in shaping diabetes outcomes, especially for economic instability (employment, out-of-pocket expenses associated with diabetes management), food insecurity, education and literacy, access to quality health care (health systems designed to effectively manage chronic disease), neighborhood and the built environment (segregated neighborhoods, socioeconomic conditions of communities, housing), and social and community context (discrimination, social support). Multiple social determinants shape poor diabetes outcomes among the insured. These determinants are now being further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created the worst economic crisis for US families since the Great Depression. The evidence of this review points to the imperative need for more multilevel intervention approaches to address these determinants in the management of diabetes.",
