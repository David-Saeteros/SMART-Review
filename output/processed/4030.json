    "Abstract": "BackgroundToinvestigate the effects of psychosocial work factors (PWF) and psychological distress (PD) on self-assessed work ability.MethodsThis follow-up study included 7,810 individuals (55%women) with good work ability at baseline. PWFandPD (measured by GHQ-12) were assessed at baseline and work ability at 7-year follow-up. Effects of PWF and PD on work ability were analyzed by logistic regression, odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI, and by mediation analysisusing 4-way decomposition.ResultsLow support was associated with poor work ability for both women and men (OR 1.78 and 1.89). For men, also low skill discretion was associated with poor work ability (OR 2.07). For both women and men, PD was associated with poor work ability (OR 3.41 and 1.84). PD did not act as an intermediate variablein the association between PWF and work ability.ConclusionStrategies for sustainable work ability should focus on both working conditions and health factors.
