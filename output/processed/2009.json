    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse the knowledge and attitudes about smoking in young people between 16-20 years of age, who were both working and attending the Vocational Education Centre.Methods: This study was conducted with high school students at the Vocational Education Centre. The socio-demographic questionnaire and the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) were applied to the students using a face-to-face interview technique. Secondly, interactive educations on smoking-free life and smoking-related diseases were given. At last, CO (carbon monoxide) levels and respiratory functions were evaluated.Results: Of the students 92.9% were males, 37.4% were 16 years, 35.8% were 17 years and 26.9% were 18-20 years old. Among 46.9% of smokers, 75.8% started smoking before 15 years of age, 86.1% were living with smokers. While 70.5%of smokers smoked more than 10 cigarettes daily, 61.3% smoked their first cigarette in the first half hour after waking up. Of the smokers, 28.8% were highly dependent, 13.0% were very highly dependent. CO levels were significantly higher in those who smoked in the workplace, who smoked mostly in the morning time, and those who started smoking at 7 years of age and younger (p <0.05). FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75 values of morning smokers were significantly lower (p <0.05).Conclusion: Unfortunately, the first smoking age was very low, the first cigarette of the day was lit in a short time after waking up, and family/friend's attitudes and behaviours were encouraging in this age group. More attention should be paid to this issue and especially new preventive projects should be implemented to protect young people from smoking.",
