    "Article Title": "Returning to work with long covid in the UK during lockdown and other COVID-19 restrictions: A qualitative study",
    "Abstract": "Few previous studies have considered the experiences of people with long covid returning to work beyond symptoms in terms of employer and other support factors. The aim of this research was to understand the experience of returning to work for those with long covid symptoms in contrast to the non-long covid group who had not experienced COVID-19 during the time restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection. Twenty-one participants with long covid and 13 participants who had not had COVID-19 were interviewed. Themes were identified from transcripts using framework analysis. Participants with long covid experienced difficulties returning to work, particularly from fatigue, cognitive symptoms and breathlessness. Symptoms were heterogeneous and fluctuated in severity over time. A lack of understanding from colleagues and managers sometimes led to a premature return to work without adequate support, associated with further long covid relapse. Outside-of-work, support was salient for a successful return to work. The standard phased return offered by employers may be too short and rigid for some people with long covid. They may benefit from a tailored intervention to support a return to work that targets symptom management, and engages with work colleagues, managers, and family members.",
