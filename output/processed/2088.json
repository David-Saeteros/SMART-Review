    "Abstract": "Background: Surgery represents a challenging medical discipline. Aim: This article focuses on psychological stress in surgery and explains resilience as a protective factor against the consequences of psychological stress, based on selected literature references and own relevant clinical experiences. In this context, the sense of coherence, social support and self-efficacy expectation are discussed in more detail as resilience factors. Method: Narrative review. Results (corner points): Surgery is classified as a challenging medical subspecialty with a high reputation but associated with diverse and varied physical and psychological stress factors. Stress factors differ individually in terms of requirements (can be overdemanding or underdemanding but also stimulating, relevant to learning and meaningful, thus positively or negatively stressful) and resources (potentially beneficial working conditions, experience, or behavior, e.g., social support, scope for action). Fluctuations within surgical specialties and a high dropout rate during residency training are well known and the causes include high psychological stress. In the case of persistent and at the same time insufficient compensation of work stress caused by a lack of or insufficient resources, these can be associated with mental illnesses. Nonetheless, many physicians spend their entire lives working in hospital or private surgical settings and remain healthy, a strong sense of resilience to mental illness may be fundamental to this. Resilience can be present as a personal characteristic or it can be learnt through a process or adapted through positive or negative influences, thus strengthening the personal characteristics. Overall, data on surgeon resilience or interventional studies in resilience research in the surgical setting are limited and provide another research gap. Resilience training (directed at a sense of coherence, social support, strengthening knowledge of coping skills, positive emotions, optimism, hope, self-efficacy expectations, control beliefs or robustness), also clearly indicated in the robust medical specialty of surgery, is always individual and should not be generalized. If the surgeon cannot retrieve sufficient resources due to the stressful situation, stress management with its methods is helpful to reduce the psychological stress and to be able to maintain the performance and health of this person. Conclusion: The consolidation of resilience as a notable aspect of employee management. In collegial interactions, resilience must be based on workplace-based approaches to strengthen coping mechanisms in the face of work stress. Workplace-related stress should also be perceived, addressed and counteracted within the organization, certainly also as an elementary management task.",
