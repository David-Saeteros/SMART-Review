    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the Republic of Serbia, to our knowledge, there has been no research dedicated to the professional stress faced by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Since speech therapy belongs to the helping professions, SLPs might experience professional stress.OBJECTIVE: To examine the levels of professional stress in SLPs concerning sociodemographic characteristics and terms of the workplace.METHODS: The research was conducted online, using a questionnaire designed to determine professional stress in speech-language pathologists - Speech-Language Pathologist Stress Inventory. The voluntary sample consisted of 185 employed SLPs from the Republic of Serbia. The stress level was observed concerning marital status, years of working experience, age, educational degree, caseload size, job sector, job setting, type of patients' diagnosis, and type of service which SLPs provide.RESULTS: The results showed that SLPs experience mild to moderate levels of professional stress and that there is a statistically significant difference in the stress level concerning years of working experience, age, job sector, and job setting. Applying Generalized Linear Mixed Model revealed that two-way interaction (Years of working experience * Marital status) and three-way interaction (Age * Job Setting * Type of patients' diagnosis) dominated on the model.CONCLUSION: Since it is noted that SLPs are experiencing mild to moderate levels of professional stress, it is important to emphasize the need for adaptation of existing work terms as well as to provide additional support to speech therapists in order to improve their mental health.",
