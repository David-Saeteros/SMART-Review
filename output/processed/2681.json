    "Article Title": "Drug Use Difficulties and Academic Adjustment in Student Veterans With Disabilities: A Parallel Mediation Study",
    "Abstract": "The attainment of postsecondary education is critical to leading a successful life. Substance abuse is one area that may negatively impact academic and, ultimately, employment outcomes in the student veteran population. We conducted a parallel mediation analysis to examine the relationship between substance use and academic outcomes in a sample of 129 college veterans with disabilities. We explored interpersonal problems, physical health problems, depression, and anxiety as possible mediators. Our results concluded that only interpersonal problems and anxiety mediated the relationship. Implications for practice and research are provided.",
