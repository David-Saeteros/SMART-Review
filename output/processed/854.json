    "Article Title": "Attempted Suicide in Shanghai Districts: A Pilot Study",
    "Abstract": "This is a pilot study whose objective was to collect data on attempted suicide in 5 districts of Shanghai and to test the feasibility of introducing an ongoing monitoring of attempted suicide. Data on a total of 363 cases were collected. The mean age of the patients was 33 years, 67% being female. Ingesting drugs or other chemical substances was the main method used for self-harm. Reasons for attempted suicide in these districts of Shanghai often appear to be related to family conflicts and unemployment. In spite of methodological limitations, the recorded data allow some preliminary conclusions regarding the characteristics of patients in districts of Shanghai admitted after a suicide attempt. Continuous monitoring of attempted suicide in this urban area of China should be established and data collection improved to raise awareness in health professionals and to develop preventive measures geared toward the needs of these patients.",
