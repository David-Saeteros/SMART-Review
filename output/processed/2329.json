    "Abstract": "Co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) negatively impacts employment outcomes for individuals with serious mental health conditions (SMHCs). This study examined how employment might help individuals manage PTSD. Sixty-eight employed individuals with SMHCs and co-occurring PTSD responded to two open-ended questions focused on how work impacted the management of PTSD symptoms and their perceived need for support from a job coach. Findings revealed themes about benefits of work on PTSD symptom management and types of provider support desired. Study implications are discussed.",
