    "Article Title": "Personal resources associated with different indicators of success in active job search: a systematic review",
    "Abstract": "The study of the different resources that will help active job search has led to identify a number of psychological and social factors which will increase the probability of being successful in searching for a job. However, we must take into account the variety of measures used and the quantity of the different psychological and social aspects in the design of social and labour guidance programmes. Therefore, in order to summarize these main psychological aspects associated with active job search, we have carried out this systematic review. The English and Spanish keywords used in this research have identified a total number of twenty studies which found a relevant positive relationship between different aspects such as active job search, personality, learning orientation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, locus of internal control, self-regulation strategies, social support and motivation. After discussing these results, new proposals were considered to have in mind in future research and in the design of new training for active employment search in the future.",
