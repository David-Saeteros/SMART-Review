    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anxiety among high-risk pregnant women in the late period of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and to evaluate the relationship between anxiety levels, attitudes-behaviors, coping styles, and other psychometric parameters.METHODS: Pregnant women who were followed up in our gynecology outpatient clinic were evaluated during their admissions between November 15, 2020 and February 15, 2021. This cross-sectional study analyzes prospectively collected data from a university hospital. Inclusion criteria were those being at risk of pregnancy and between the age of 18 and 45 years, while exclusion criteria were mental retardation and the presence of serious psychiatric illness. The study included 140 participants. Sociodemographic and pregnant attitudes-behaviors data form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Coping Styles Scale Brief Form (Brief-COPE), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were used to collect data.RESULTS: Participants had high anxiety levels (State-STAI: 40.32 +/- 9.88; Trait-STAI: 42.71 +/- 7.32) and high prevalence of probable clinical anxiety [State-STAI: 84 (60.0%); Trait-STAI: 92 (65.7%)]. The fact concerning the transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 to the baby during pregnancy/birth, extent to which coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic prevents regular pregnancy checkups, and family subgroup-Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support predicted state probable clinical anxiety. Use of disinfectants predicted trait probable clinical anxiety. Employment status predicted state/trait probable clinical anxiety. The existence of trait probable clinical anxiety was significantly associated with behavioral disengagement and substance use which are considered ineffective coping styles. Participants without trait probable clinical anxiety had significantly more adopted positive reinterpretation, one of emotion-focused coping styles.CONCLUSION: Based on our results, the concern of the transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 to the babies during pregnancy/birth may be the main factor influencing anxiety among high-risk pregnant women.",
