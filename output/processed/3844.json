    "Abstract": "Objective Substantial literature has documented adverse childhood experiences' (ACEs) link with poor health in childhood and adulthood. Despite many American low-income families spending more than a third of their income toward housing costs, little research has been published about a link between severe housing-cost burden and ACEs. The objective of this study was to examine the association of severe housing-cost burden to the ACEs to which young, low-income children are exposed. Methods Participants were 2-5-year-olds who participated in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in Los Angeles County. We used data from the 2017 Los Angeles County WIC Survey, a survey of a random sample of all WIC participants living in Los Angeles County. Separate multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of severe housing-cost burden (very difficult to pay for housing) with the ACEs of financial hardship (household food insecurity, extreme poverty, parent's unemployment and underemployment), household dysfunction (parent's poor mental well-being and parent's separation), housing insecurity (doubled up and residential instability), and parent's experience with homelessness. Results Sixteen percent of children lived in severe housing-cost burdened households and 14% experienced at least 4 ACEs. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and social support, severe housing-cost burden was associated with an increase in the odds of each of the ACEs. Conclusions for Practice While further research is needed, findings highlight the need for policymakers to provide resources and support for housing-cost burdened children. Also, service providers should identify ACEs among housing cost-burdened children.",
