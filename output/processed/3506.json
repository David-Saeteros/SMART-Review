    "Abstract": "Limited empirical data have been available on the adult sequelae of childhood homelessness. Using nationally representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, we compared a hierarchy of adults who were never homeless, those who were only homeless as children, and those who were homeless both as children and adults, hypothesizing greater adversity as one moved up the three-level hierarchy on sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifetime mental health diagnostic characteristics. As a further evaluation of the status of adults who were homeless as both children and adults, we compared this highest risk group to those who had been homeless only as adults. Individuals who experienced childhood homelessness were 46.9 times more likely than others to also experience adult homelessness. Testing the hierarchical hypothesis, compared with those who were never homeless, individuals who experienced homelessness only as children reported numerous associated disadvantages, including childhood sexual abuse/neglect, parental adversities, adult incarceration, psychiatric disorders, and low academic achievement/employment. Those reporting both child and adult homelessness, in contrast to childhood homelessness alone, additionally met the criteria for multiple substance use disorders, confirming our hierarchical hypothesis. Those reporting both child and adult homelessness also showed more numerous social and psychiatric problems when compared with those experiencing homelessness for the first time as adults. This study demonstrates how homelessness in childhood is associated with extensive social and psychiatric adversities in both childhood and adulthood.",
