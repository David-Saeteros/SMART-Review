    "Abstract": "In this article, we examine social support received by mature employees in the context of intermediate labour market and outside working life. In our study the levels and forms of social support were analysed by applying data-led content analysis. The research data comprises thematic interviews of individuals aged 50 or above who have become employed in the intermediate labour market (n = 15). The social support received by mature employees took the form of primary support provided by the people closest to them and secondary support from colleagues, while relatively little support was provided by superiors. The observations included strong reciprocal social support on the primary and secondary levels. Reciprocal help and social support among mature employees was shown to be a significant resource in their social circles, with positive effects that extend to society in general. The research showed the strong role of mature employees as bearers of responsibility in both the local community and in the workplace community. One of the outcomes of this study was the discovery of a fourth dimension of collective, reciprocal support, taking the form of voluntary work carried out by the mature employees. Voluntary work, in its various forms, boosted their resilience as well as their ability to manage the obstacles of everyday life and the challenges arising from unemployment. These mature clients continue to be an unutilized resource in community-based social work.",
