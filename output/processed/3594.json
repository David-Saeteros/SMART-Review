    "Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) can create significant financial burden, with cost of living rising consistently with increasing age and disability. We aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of financial strain among a large sample of older Canadians with MS. A binomial logistic regression, which estimates the probability of an event happening (financial strain-yes/no), was performed. Participants were 64.6 (SD +/- 6.2) years old and reported living with MS symptoms 32.8 (SD +/- 9.4) years. In total, 22% of participants experienced financial strain. Predictors of financial strain (from greatest to least) were not having private health insurance, job loss due to MS, having moderate to high stress, greater physical impact of MS, not having home adaptations, not having social support, and living alone. These findings point to insufficiencies in Canada's health and social systems when it comes to the provision of universal care to those living with disabling neurological chronic illness.",
