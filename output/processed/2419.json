    "Article Title": "Career counselling mid-career laid-off workers",
    "Abstract": "Jobs in the manufacturing sector have been largely relocated to countries offering a competitive advantage, particularly in terms of labour costs. For this reason, mid-career workers from this sector and from western countries have been largely displaced. These mid-career workers from the manufacturing sector are subsequently forced to compete for jobs in the newly booming service industry sector. This unplanned transition can be financially and psychologically challenging. This article investigates the consequences of institutional and individual stigma of unemployment as well as the mental health challenges associated with unemployment. Then three career psychology theories are applied as counselling strategies for this population, including Dawis and Lofquist's work adjustment theory; Krumboltz's social learning theory; and Cochran's narrative career counselling.",
