    "Article Title": "Symptomatic and Functional Remission in Young Adults with a Psychotic Disorder in a Rehabilitation Focused Team",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess symptomatic remission (SR) and functional remission (FR) in a rehabilitation focused program for young adults with a psychotic disorder in the Netherlands, and to investigate which individual and mental health care factors are associated with SR and/or FR, by using Routine Outcome Monitoring data and data on met needs and unmet needs for care. Data of 287 young adults were collected. Almost 40% achieved or maintained SR, 34% FR, and 26% achieved or maintained both. In addition to sociodemographic factors, living independently, paid employment, higher levels of compliance with treatment, and better fulfillment of unmet needs for care in relation to psychological distress, company and daytime activities were associated with better outcomes on SR and/or FR. Our findings underscore that to successfully improve and sustain remission in young adults with a psychotic disorder, it is needed to conduct specific research into the relationship between SR and FR.",
