    "Abstract": "Stress impacts our physical and mental health as well as our social life. A passive and contactless indoor stress monitoring system can unlock numerous important applications such asworkplace productivity assessment, smart homes, and personalized mental health monitoring. While the thermal signatures from a user's body captured by a thermal camera can provide important information about the fight-flight response of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, relying solely on thermal imaging for training a stress prediction model often lead to overfitting and consequently a suboptimal performance. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing ThermaStrain, a novel co-teaching framework that achieves high-stress prediction performance by transferring knowledge from the wearable modality to the contactless thermal modality. During training, ThermaStrain incorporates a wearable electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor to generate stress-indicative representations from thermal videos, emulating stress-indicative representations from a wearable EDA sensor. During testing, only thermal sensing is used, and stress-indicative patterns from thermal data and emulated EDA representations are extracted to improve stress assessment. The study collected a comprehensive dataset with thermal video and EDA data under various stress conditions and distances. ThermaStrain achieves an F1 score of 0.8293 in binary stress classification, outperforming the thermal-only baseline approach by over 9%. Extensive evaluations highlight ThermaStrain's effectiveness in recognizing stress-indicative attributes, its adaptability across distances and stress scenarios, real-time executability on edge platforms, its applicability to multi-individual sensing, ability to function on limited visibility and unfamiliar conditions, and the advantages of its co-teaching approach. These evaluations validate ThermaStrain's fidelity and its potential for enhancing stress assessment.",
