    "Abstract": "Improved outcomes for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have opened a range of potential pathways during the transition to adulthood. These include attending college, entering the labor force, and achieving a degree of independent living. Less cognitively able individuals may be eligible for state benefits and may enter supported employment programs. Those attending college require careful support and planning. Practitioners need to be familiar with the unique needs of young adults with ASD. Further research should attempt to define the priorities of individuals and families with ASD making this transition and clarify the value of existing supports and interventions.",
