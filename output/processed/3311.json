    "Abstract": "Background/objective The impact a cancer diagnosis and its treatment are affected by psychosocial factors and how these factors interrelate among themselves. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between optimism and social support in spiritual wellbeing in cancer patients initiating chemotherapy. Methods A cross-sectional, multi-center (15 sites), prospective study was conducted with 912 cancer patients who had undergone curative surgery for a stage I-III cancer and were to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. They completed the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Spiritual Well-being Scale (FACIT-Sp), Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results Significant differences on spirituality scales (meaning/peace and faith) were detected depending on age (<= 65 vs > 65), sex, marital status, employment, and cancer treatment. Married or partnered participants had significantly higher meaning/peace scores compared to their non-partnered counterparts (p = 0.001). Women, > 65 years, unemployed, and patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy had significantly higher faith scores versus men, <= 65 years, employed, and subjects only receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (all p < 0.030). Multivariate analyses indicated that meaning/peace and faith correlated positively with optimism and social support. Conclusion During oncological treatment, the positive effects of optimism and social support exhibit a positive correlation with spiritual coping. A brief assessment evaluation of these factors can aid in identifying at risk for a worse adaptation to the disease.",
