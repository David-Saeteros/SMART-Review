    "Abstract": "The limited literature on employment in people with severe mental illnesses (SMI) in developing countries suggests higher rates than in developed countries. The present study explored rates and associated characteristics of work in people receiving public psychiatric services. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 150 individuals with SMI (90% schizophrenia-spectrum) receiving public outpatient psychiatric services in an urban district in western India to evaluate employment. Forty percent of participants were employed, most for independent employers (86.7%), and were working an average of 53 hours/week. Earning money was reported as the primary motivation to work. A high proportion (92.2%) of unemployed participants wanted to work. Common barriers to work for unemployed participants who were interested in working were psychological (e.g., stress), mental illness (e.g., symptoms), and work-related factors (e.g., difficulty finding a job). Help finding a job and managing mental illness were the primary desired supports. Rates of employment in people with SMI living in urban areas in India are higher than in developed countries, but much lower than the general population. The high interest in work coupled with specific barriers and desired supports point to the need for vocational rehabilitation for improving the employment functioning of people with SMI in India.",
