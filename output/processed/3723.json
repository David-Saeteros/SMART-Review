    "Article Title": "Male Nursing Students' Social Appearance Anxiety and Their Coping Attitudes",
    "Abstract": "This study aimed at examining social appearance anxiety levels of male nursing students and their coping attitudes and identifying the relationship between them. A cross-sectional research approach was adopted in a study population of 180; the sample comprised 129 students. Data were collected using a socio-demographic information form, the Social Appearance Anxiety Scale (SAAS), and the Assessment of Coping Attitudes Inventory (COPE). The average age of students was 20.54 +/- 1.49 years. The male students' average score obtained from the SAAS measure was 32.64 +/- 13.07, while that of the COPE Inventory was 138.11 +/- 14.47. Significant correlations were detected between students' SAAS scores and COPE scale scores. There were negative relationships between social anxiety scores and COPE subscales of positive reinterpretation and growth (p < .05), use of instrumental social support (p < .05), active coping (p <= .01), and planning (p <= .01). In contrast, there were positive relationships between social anxiety scores and COPE subscales of mental disengagement (p <= .01), denial (p <= .01), behavioral disengagement (p <= .01), restraint (p <= .01), use of emotional social support (p < .05), substance use (p <= .01), and acceptance (p < .05). The conclusion was that male students who do not perceive themselves as having an ideal body image face high social appearance anxiety. There is a prejudice that social appearance anxiety has negative effects on these students' self-confidence. In this context, this research revealed concrete results about how male nursing students have battled the prejudices that they have faced throughout their student life.",
