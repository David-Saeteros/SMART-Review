    "Article Title": "Feasibility of a Career Development Intervention for Veterans in Vocational Rehabilitation: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial",
    "Abstract": "Background: Veterans with psychiatric disorders want additional career development services to support their recovery and pursuit of meaningful employment. However, no career counseling programs have been designed for this specific population. We developed the Purposeful Pathways intervention to fill this need.Objective: This study protocol aims to (1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Purposeful Pathways intervention for veterans living with psychiatric disorders and (2) explore preliminary clinical outcome data.Methods: A total of 50 veterans who are participating in transitional work vocational rehabilitation services at a Veterans Affairs hospital will be randomized to either treatment as usual or the augmented treatment condition (treatment as usual plus Purposeful Pathways). Feasibility will be assessed via recruitment rates, clinician fidelity to treatment, retention rates, and acceptability of randomization procedures. Acceptability will be assessed via client satisfaction at treatment termination using quantitative and qualitative data collection. Preliminary clinical and vocational outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks (treatment termination), and a 3-month follow-up via quantitative measures assessing vocational functioning, vocational process, and mental and physical functioning.Results: This pilot randomized controlled trial is beginning recruitment in June 2023 and is expected to continue through November 2025. Data collection is expected to be completed by February 2026, with full data analysis completed by March 2026.Conclusions: Findings from this study will provide information on the feasibility and acceptability of the Purposeful Pathways intervention, as well as secondary outcomes related to vocational functioning, vocational process, and mental and physical functioning.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04698967; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04698967",
