    "Abstract": "Objective: Mental health is seen as the most basic condition for a good quality of life. Those with a high level of happiness are believed to be healthier and more successful in interpersonal relationships. This study aims to determine the factors associated with the happiness levels of women and men in Turkiye during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: In this study, the microdata set obtained from the Life Satisfaction Survey conducted by TURKSTAT in 2020 was utilized. Using generalized ordered logistic regression analysis, the factors associated with the happiness levels of men and women were determined.Results: According to the study's findings, factors such as age, marital status, level of education, source of happiness (individual), general satisfaction level, level of satisfaction with health, and level of hope for the future are related to the happiness levels of women and men. In the study, it was determined that the importance and effect of the variables vary according to the happiness levels of men and women. It was revealed that employment status and household income were solely associated with the probability of being very happy/happy among men. It was determined that the happiness source (what) and household size variables were only associated with the probability of women being very happy/happy.Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be advantageous to implement initiatives that increase the level of happiness for men and women, strengthen emotional support, and provide better health care.",
