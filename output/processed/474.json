    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Climacteric is a natural process in females that occurs on average between 45-55 years: during this period, symptoms can be experienced that have a negative impact on the ability to work. As the older female population is increasingly prevalent in the labor market, it becomes relevant to investigate the issue. Methodology: In order to carry out this Integrative Bibliographic Review, in January 2019 a research was carried out on the B-on platform and on the EBSCOhost platform with the inclusion of the databases: CINAHL\u00aeComplete, MEDLINE Complete, Nursing & Allied Health Collection: Comprehensive, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Methodology Register, Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts, Mediclatina. The articles were selected by the PICo method. Content: Several articles have shown that the symptoms are not uniform among workers, with the most prevalent being vasomotor (hot flushes and night sweats), irritability, concentration deficit, depression, poor memory, general tiredness and joint pain. Strategies are suggested to help mitigate the negative impact of climacteric symptomatology in women by raising awareness to the management positions and to the occupational health services of the problem, implementing education and health promotion programs, allowing greater control of temperature and/or ventilation, to wear layered clothes, access to fresh water, sharing of experiences and practice of physical exercise. Conclusions: Although the relevance of the theme increases with the aging of the active female population, it still lacks studies on the subject. It is concluded that the symptoms affect the ability to work, but the workplaces are not yet adapted to mitigate the negative effects of the climacteric symptoms.",
