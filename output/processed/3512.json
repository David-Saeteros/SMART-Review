    "Abstract": "AimTo understand staff factors associated with patient aggression towards the staff of an inpatient forensic psychiatric hospital.BackgroundViolence by patients is a serious concern in psychiatric hospitals and staff are the most frequent targets of physical and verbal assault. Assault and its consequences can severely disrupt the hospital environment and impair the functioning of staff members and patients. This study examined the interplay of staff dispositional and interpersonal factors associated with patient violence.DesignThis cross-sectional study surveyed the staff of a large public forensic hospital.MethodsA sample of 348 psychiatric staff participated in an online survey about their workplace experiences, psychosocial characteristics and well-being. Data were collected from November - December 2011.FindingsNearly all staff reported verbal conflict with patients (99%) and 70% reported being assaulted during the previous 12months. Verbal conflict with other staff (92%) was also high. Multiple regression analyses indicated that in addition to static risk factors (i.e. staff position, years of experience and gender), the risk of assault was associated with the frequency of conflicts with staff and patients, which in turn was moderated by personal stress reactivity.ConclusionPhysical violence by patients was a pervasive threat for a high proportion of staff. Frequent conflict interactions with volatile patients contributed the most risk, but reactivity to conflict was a dynamic risk factor. The strain associated with assault risk and stress reactivity could be prospectively mitigated by resilience enhancement programming for staff.",
