    "Article Title": "Influence of Burnout and Feelings of Guilt on Depression and Health in Anesthesiologists",
    "Abstract": "Background and objective: The WHO has included burnout as an occupational phenomenon in the ICD-11. According to the WHO, burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. The study aimed to evaluate the influence of feelings of guilt and burnout on health in Polish anesthesiologists. Alcohol and tobacco intake, psychosomatic disorders, and depression were assessed. Methods: The study had a non-randomized cross-sectional character. The sample consisted of 372 Polish anesthesiologists. Burnout was measured by the Spanish burnout inventory. Results: Post hoc analysis for burnout consequences: depression (F-(5,F-366) = 17.51, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.193), psychosomatic disorders (F-(5,F-366) = 13.11, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.152), and tobacco intake (F-(5,F-366) = 6.23, p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.078), showed significant differences between burnout with and without the highest levels of feelings of guilt. All the instruments applied were reliable. Conclusions: Depression, psychosomatic disorders, and alcohol and tobacco intake are suspected to be consequences of the highest guilt levels related to burnout, i.e., Profile 2 according to the burnout model of Gil-Monte. Participation in prevention programs is recommended for these cases.",
