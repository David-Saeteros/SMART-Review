    "Abstract": "The Mental Health Department of Piacenza has recently activated a special program for persons diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The Program engages a number of stakeholders: the users, their families, social and psychiatric services as well as specific associations for autism. The program is aimed to grant a complete and individualized assistance to people with ASD and it is especially focused on the transition to adulthood. In this period, it is necessary to build the life project in order to improve functioning and quality of life of users. The elective areas of the individual plan have to deal on how to reach autonomy in daily living and related skills, obtaining and maintaining a job, as well as starting and reinforcing significant relationships. This paper is especially focused on job placement for people with ASD.",
