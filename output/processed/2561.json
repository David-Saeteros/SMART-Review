    "Abstract": "Aims and objectives To examine the effect of working with a facility dog on paediatric healthcare professionals' work-related burnout, job perceptions and mental health.Background Due to their roles caring for ill children and distressed families, paediatric healthcare professionals often experience substantial depression and burnout. According to prior research, facility dogs in children's hospitals may provide significant benefits to paediatric patients. However, their potential effects on healthcare professionals have been minimally explored.Design A cross-sectional design was used in adherence to the STROBE checklist.Method Among 130 participants, n = 65 paediatric healthcare professionals working with a facility dog were compared to n = 65 control participants matched on age, gender identity, job position category and pet ownership. Hierarchical regression assessed the effect of working with a facility dog on standardised self-report measures of work-related burnout, job perceptions and mental health.Results For work-related burnout, working with a facility dog was associated with higher perceived personal accomplishment, but had no effect on emotional exhaustion. With respect to job perceptions, working with a facility dog was associated with more positive job descriptions and lower intention to quit, but not with perceptions about co-workers or workplace social support. Finally, in relation to mental health, working with a facility dog was associated with more positive emotions, better perceived mental health and less depression, but had no effect on anxiety.Conclusion Findings suggest that facility dogs may be related to several benefits for healthcare professionals' work-related burnout, job perceptions and mental health, but that they do not influence all components of these areas.Relevance to clinical practice The present research functions to inform personnel in paediatric hospitals with existing facility dog programmes on the scope of their effects, in addition to shaping the expectations of hospitals considering the addition of a facility dog programme.",
