    "Abstract": "One major concern of Asian Americans with psychiatric disabilities is underutilization of services, furthermore their service needs and accessibility have been significantly understudied. This study examined the effects of the public vocational rehabilitation (VR) services on employment outcomes for Asian Americans with psychiatric disabilities in the United States. This study investigated which individual characteristics, work disincentives, and VR service types were related to competitive employment outcomes among Asian Americans with psychiatric disabilities and compared the findings to other racial/ethnic groups. Logistic regression analyses were used to analyze a sample of RSA-911 data from fiscal year 2013. The results provided empirical support regarding VR services and employment outcomes for Asian Americans with psychiatric disabilities. Specifically, level of education, work experiences, and receipt of health insurance benefits were significantly related to employment outcomes among the Asian American group. Regarding VR services, job placement assistance, on-the-job supports, maintenance, miscellaneous training, and other services also predicted employment outcomes. Future research needs to address the impact of specific cultural factors on access to VR services, service utilization, and employment outcomes.",
