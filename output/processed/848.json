    "Abstract": "Background: While there is increasing recognition of disparities in healthcare for Black Americans, there have been no comparisons in a nationally representative U.S. sample of Black and White adults with clinical diagnoses of schizophrenia. Methods: Using nationally representative survey data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Re-lated Conditions-III, we compared Black (n = 240, 36.2%) and White (n = 423, 63.8%) adults who report having been told by a physician that they have schizophrenia. Due to the large sample size, effect sizes (risk ratios and Cohen's d), rather than p-values, were used to identify the magnitude of differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including experiences of discrimination and service use. Multivariate analyses were used to identify independent factors. Results: Black individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia reported multiple sociodemographic disadvantages, including lower rates of employment, educational attainment, income, marriage, and social support, with little difference in incarceration, violent behavior, and quality of life. They reported much higher scores on a general lifetime discrimination scale (Cohen's d = 0.75) and subscales representing job discrimination (d = 0.85), health system discrimination (d = 0.70), and public race-based abuse (d = 0.55) along with higher rates of past year alcohol and drug use disorders, but lower rates of co-morbid psychiatric disorders. Multivariable-adjusted re-gression analyses highlighted the independent association of Black race with measures of discrimination and re-ligious service attendance; less likelihood of receiving psychiatric treatment (p = 0.02) but no difference in substance use treatment. Conclusion: Black adults with schizophrenia report numerous social disadvantages, especially discrimination, but religious service attendance may be an important social asset. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.
