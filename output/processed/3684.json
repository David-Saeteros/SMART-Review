    "Abstract": "Objectives We assessed the role of social support in presenteeism by examining organizational commitment among Chinese healthcare workers. Methods One thousand four hundred thirty-four healthcare workers from 6 hospitals in 4 Chinese cities completed a questionnaire measuring presenteeism, social support, and organizational commitment. With organizational commitment as the mediator, regression analyses and structural equation modeling were used to test the model. Results Organizational commitment was directly inversely associated with presenteeism (beta = - 0.42, p < 0.001). Coworker support was moderately but significantly inversely associated with presenteeism (beta = - 0.15, p < 0.001), but the path from supervisor support to presenteeism was not significant (beta = 0.05, p > 0.05). The correlation between supervisor support and coworker support was significant (beta = 0.71, p <0.001). Supervisor support and coworker support were significantly positively associated with organizational commitment (beta = 0.41, p < 0.001, and beta = 0.14, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions Supervisor support was more important in promoting organizational commitment, while coworker support was more effective in reducing presenteeism. The mediating effect of organizational commitment was significant.",
