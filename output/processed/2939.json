    "Article Title": "Heterogeneous depressive symptom trajectories among women with type 2 diabetes: findings from the Women's Interagency HIV Study",
    "Abstract": "Background: Depression affects 33% of women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and leads to increased risks of premature mortality. Fluctuation and variation of depressive presentations can hinder clinical identification. Purpose: We aimed to identify and examine subgroups characterized by distinct depressive symptom trajectories among women with T2D. Methods: This retrospective analysis leveraged the Women's Interagency HIV Study data to identify depressive symptom trajectories based on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scores (2014-2019) among women with and without HIV. Descriptive statistics characterized sample demographics (eg, age, race, income), clinical indices (eg, hemoglobin A1C [HbA1c], BMI, HIV status), and psychosocial experiences (eg, discrimination, social support, anxiety, pain). We used growth mixture modeling to identify groups defined by distinct depressive symptom trajectories and parametric and non-parametric tests to examine demographic, clinical, and psychosocial differences across subgroups. Results: Among the 630 women included, the mean age was 50.4 (SD = 8.3) years, 72.4% identified as Black and non-Hispanic, and 68.2% were living with HIV. Five subgroups were identified and distinguished by severity and symptom type. Participants with lower incomes (P = .01), lower employment (P < .0001), lower social support (P = .0001), and experiences of discrimination (P < .0001) showed greater membership in threshold, moderate, and severe depressive subgroups. Subgroup membership was not associated with metabolic indices (BMI, HbA1c) or HIV status. Anxiety, pain, and loneliness (all P = .0001) were worse in subgroups with higher depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Among women with T2D, depressive symptom trajectories differ across clinical and social contexts. This study advances precision by delineating subgroups within a broad clinical category.",
