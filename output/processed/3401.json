    "Abstract": "Objectives Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has profound implications for patients and families. The aim of the present study was to gain insights into the effects caring for a child with SMA has on the costs incurred by families caring for a child with SMA from carer perspectives to identify gaps in provision of care, inform public policy and cost-effectiveness analyses.Design Interpretive phenomenological analysis guided the delivery and analysis of semi-structured interviews undertaken to explore the financial, opportunity and psychosocial costs associated with caring for children with SMA.Participants and setting Parents of children with SMA types II and III from a single Australian paediatric neuromuscular clinic participated in this study.Results A range of experiences were reported and information saturation (n=7) was reached endorsing themes, including: significant financial and caregiving burdens, adjusted career choices and limitations on career progression and a complex landscape of access to funding, equipment, support and resources. Opportunity costs of foregone employment, purchases and leisure activities were substantial, as were emotional and social impacts. Participants voiced determination and resilience, and called for continued efforts to improve supportive care services and resources.Conclusions The range and nature of costs met by families caring for a child with SMA were found to be expansive and not typically recognised. These include high direct costs associated with goods and services, indirect costs associated with voluntary care, substantial and long-term opportunities foregone in paid employment and career progression and unmeasured or hidden costs associated with mental health burden.",
