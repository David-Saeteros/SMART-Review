    "Abstract": "Background: Considering the chronic and debilitating nature of HIV infection, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important patient-reported clinical outcome to better understand the effects of this infection and its treatment on patients' lives. The purpose of this study was to assess the HRQoL and its association with sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical, nutrition-related factors and social support in an Irish HIV cohort.Methods: A cross-sectional, prospective study using the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health survey assessed the 10 dimensions of HRQoL and summarised as Physical Health Summary (PHS) and Mental Health Summary (MHS) scores. Participants were categorised as having good or poor PHS and MHS using the standardised mean score of 50. The variables independently associated with PHS and MHS were identified using multivariable logistic regression models.Results: Overall, 521 participants completed the HRQoL questionnaire. The median (IQR) PHS and MHS scores were 56 (47-60) and 51 (41-58) respectively. All the covariate groups had lower MHS than PHS. Participants with symptoms of HIV reported the lowest median (IQR) PHS score 44.7 (32.-54.5) and MHS score 36.1 (28.6-48.4). Of the 10 dimensions of HRQoL, the lowest scores were for the energy level and general health. Symptoms of HIV, co-morbidities, social support, employment and ethnicity had independent association with both PHS and MHS. Gender, education, alcohol intake and HIV-complications were associated with PHS. Age, illicit drugs, BMI and malnutrition were associated with MHS. However, CD4 count and viral load were not independently associated with PHS and MHS in multivariable regression models.Conclusion: Overall, HIV-infected people in this cohort had an average level of HRQoL. However, it is impaired in people with symptoms and co-morbidities, and not independently associated with CD4 and viral load. Alleviating HIV symptoms and preventing co-morbidities are important in managing HIV. Providing psychosocial supports for behaviour modification and return to work or exploring new opportunities will help to improve HRQoL. Healthcare providers and policy makers need to plan and implement programs to routinely assess the HRQoL in a systematic method to facilitate a holistic management of HIV.",
