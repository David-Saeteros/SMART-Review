    "Abstract": "A better understanding of the role of psychosocial resources and factors associated with participating in patient support groups appears to be important for the development and implementation of cancer survivorship care plans. We therefore investigated the frequency of participation in and satisfaction with patient support groups after completion of a rehabilitation programme and aimed to examine differences in demographic, medical and psychosocial characteristics between group participants and non-participants. We further aimed to identify predictors of participation in patient support groups. A total of 1281 eligible patients (75.5% participation rate) were recruited on average 11 months post diagnosis and assessed at the beginning (t(1)), at the end (t(2)) and 12 months after rehabilitation (t(3)). Study participants completed self-report measures assessing support-group participation and satisfaction, psychosocial distress (anxiety, fear of cancer recurrence, depression), social support, coping, quality of life, pain and treatment-related characteristics. Sixty-seven patients (7.6%) participated in a patient self-help group. Being unemployed, undergoing an increased number of overall treatments, and a higher active emotion-oriented coping style significantly predicted self-help group participation; the predictive power of the multivariate logistic regression model was rather weak (Nagelkerke's R-2 = 0.07). Our data provide evidence that self-help group participation in cancer patients may be largely related to other factors than medical or psychosocial distress.",
