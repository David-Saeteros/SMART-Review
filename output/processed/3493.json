    "Abstract": "COVID-19 has significantly exacerbated negative health and social outcomes for people who use drugs (PWUD) around the world. The closure of harm reduction services, ongoing barriers to employment and housing, and pre-existing physical and mental health conditions have increased harms for diverse communities of PWUD. Adapting current models of health and human service delivery to better meet the needs of PWUD is essential in minimizing not only COVID-19 but also drug-related morbidity and mortality. This article draws on research, practice, and advocacy experiences, and discusses the potential for digital health tools such as remote monitoring and telecare to improve the continuum of care for PWUD. We call for a digital health strategy for PWUD and provide recommendations for future program development and implementation.",
