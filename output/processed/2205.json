    "Abstract": "Kidney transplantation (KTx) in end-stage renal disease is associated with a significant increase in quality of life (QoL) and self-perceived health, optimally leading to the maintenance of employment or return to work (RTW) in working-age patients. The aim of this study was to assess individual factors including the QoL and mental health of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) associated with employment after transplantation. A cross-sectional study including working-age patients with a history of KTx after 2012 was conducted at two Austrian study centers (Vienna and Graz). Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref) and Workability Index (WAI) were assessed along with detailed questionnaires on employment status. Out of n = 139 KTRs (43.2 +/- 9.07 years; 57.6% male), 72 (51.8%) were employed. Employed patients were more frequently in a partnership (p = 0.018) and had higher education levels (p = 0.01) and QoL scores (<0.001). Unemployed KTRs reported fatigue and mental health issues more often (p < 0.001), and had significantly higher anxiety, depression and somatization scores (BSI-18). In unadjusted logistical regression, workability score (WAS; odds ratio (OR) = 3.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.97-5.82; p < 0.001), partnership (OR = 5.47; 95% CI 1.43-20.91; p = 0.013) and no psychological counseling after KTx (OR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.003-0.969; p = 0.048) were independently associated with employment. Self-assessed mental health, workability and QoL were significantly associated with employment status after KTx. Thus, in order to facilitate RTW after KTx in Austria, vocational rehabilitation and RTW programs addressing KTRs should focus on increasing social support and care for their mental health.",
