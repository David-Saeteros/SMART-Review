    "Article Title": "Enhancing agency in career development via cognitive information processing theory",
    "Abstract": "The interconnected aspects of career and mental health posit career as a central feature of human functioning. A perceived lack of control within career and work exacerbates existing challenges associated with COVID-19. Focusing on enhancing agency within the realm of career and work is imperative within counselling. Cognitive Information Processing (CIP) accounts for the complexity of career concerns by enhancing agency in career decision making, with problem solving serving as a conduit between uncertainty and empowerment. The current state of employment, threats to agency within career development, and specific CIP-based interventions to enhance agency are discussed.",
