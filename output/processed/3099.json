    "Abstract": "ObjectivesThere is consensus that empowerment is key to recovery from mental health problems, enabling a person to take charge of their life and make informed choices and decisions about their life. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which empowerment affects mental health in young people. The current study involved young people aged 16-29years and examined empowerment as a potential mediator of the relationship between psychological factors (psychosocial, cognition, coping, and control) and mental health, well-being, and recovery from personal problems.MethodsA cross-sectional, Internet-based questionnaire study recruited 423 young people aged between 16 and 29 attending universities in England (n=336) and Ireland (n=87). Psychological factors, mental well-being, empowerment, and recovery from personal problems were measured using self-report measures.ResultsMediation analysis in both the single and one over-arching mediator models revealed that empowerment mediates the relationship between psychological factors (psychosocial, self-efficacy, thinking style, coping, and control) and mental health, well-being, and recovery from general life problems.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the importance of empowerment, showing that it mediates the relationship between psychological processes and mental health, well-being, and recovery in young people. Clinical implications for working with young people within mental health services, and facilitating their empowerment are discussed.",
