    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between demographic variables, vocational rehabilitation (VR) services and employment outcomes for people with depression and other mood disorders. The Rehabilitation Services Administration's Case Service Reports database for Fiscal-Year 2013 was examined using multivariable logistic regression. Results indicated that participants who received on-the-job support, technical assistance, job placement, maintenance, on-the-job training, other services, occupational/vocational training, information-referral, job search, and vocational rehabilitation counseling were more likely to achieve competitive employment than participants who did not receive those services. Having a higher level of education, and not receiving cash benefits were positively associated with competitive employment. Hispanic or Latino and 36-54 years old participants were more likely to achieve competitive employment. The study shows that people with depression and other mood disorders may benefit from job related support services.",
