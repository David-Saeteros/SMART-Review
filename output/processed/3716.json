    "Article Title": "Strategies to Reduce the Impact of Trauma in Psychiatric Nurses: An Integrative Review of the Literature",
    "Abstract": "BackgroundPsychiatric nurses are at a higher risk for exposure to violence and aggression, leading to potential burnout, moral injury, post-traumatic stress, and turnover. There is little evidence of a preferred strategy to support nurses and decrease the impact of traumatic experiences on psychiatric nurses. The aim of this integrative review was to explore potential strategies to decrease the impact of traumatic experiences among nurses in psychiatric settings.MethodsFollowing a systematic search of PsycINFO/Ovid, CINAHL, and MEDLINE/Pubmed, Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal tools were used to analyze quality of the articles. Thirteen articles met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study. Data were analyzed and synthesized into three key themes and seven sub-themes.ResultsThree themes were noted to be common to the included texts. 1. Interpersonal Supports (Formal Support, Peer/Supervisor Support, and Informal Family/Social Support). 2. Organizational Supports (Perception of Job Safety/Satisfaction, Promoting Personal Resilience, Supporting Team Resilience, and Organizational Commitment to Resilience). 3. Protection of Personal Resources.ConclusionsMany common suggestions for decreasing the impact of exposure to violence and trauma were noted across the thirteen articles, however, there is little evidence of a preferred strategy, how strategies are developed and employed or the efficacy of any particular strategy. Further investigation is needed to identify and evaluate supportive interventions, their feasibility and efficacy.",
