    "Article Title": "Federal Policies and Programs to Expand Employment Services Among Individuals with Serious Mental Illnesses",
    "Abstract": "Previous studies suggest that providing employment services to individuals with serious mental illnesses can help them obtain competitive, real-world employment. However, these services are still not easily accessible to this population. This paper provides a brief summary of recent federal initiatives that may influence widespread implementation of employment services. While there is an increasing recognition of the need to remove barriers and provide supported employment services to individuals with mental illnesses, a wide-spread coordination across Federal polices, financing and regulatory changes are necessary to promote measurable and lasting effects on the broad availability of employment services among this population.",
