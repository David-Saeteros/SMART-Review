    "Article Title": "Vocational Rehabilitation Professionals' Perceptions of Facilitators and Barriers to Return to Work: A Qualitative Descriptive Study",
    "Abstract": "This is a qualitative descriptive study of professionals' perceptions of facilitators and barriers for returning to work for women on long-term sick leave due to musculoskeletal pain and/or common mental disorder who participated in a vocational rehabilitation project. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 13 purposefully selected professionals from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Swedish Public Employment Service, the health care services, and the municipal services. The interviews were analyzed with a manifest content analysis. The main facilitators were the close cooperation between the professionals and the individual support that was offered to the project participants. The main barriers were differences among the stakeholders' missions and goals, limitation in project duration and within the labor market, and the project participants' personal factors. These results emphasize the importance of cooperation between the professionals from the various stakeholders and focus on the individual's resources and needs. The study highlights the value of including health care professionals in vocational rehabilitation to benefit from their specific knowledge of the target group and their strengths and needs. Moreover, the study highlights the need to incorporate collaboration with employers and align with the local labor market in the development of vocational rehabilitation interventions.",
