    "Article Title": "Developing a competency framework for managers to address suicide risk in the workplace",
    "Abstract": "Employee mental health, and in particular, suicide risks, are things that managers often do not feel comfortable in addressing, leading to lack of knowledge, awareness, and support within an organization. The purpose of this research was to investigate the competencies required by managers to enable them to effectively address suicide risks arising with employees. Suicide-related ideations are thought to be characterized by experiences of burdensomeness and thwarted connectedness. Drawing on clinical, managerial, and adaptive performance competencies, we examined competencies related to creating meaningfulness (as a counter to burdensomeness) and addressing employee's need for relatedness (as a counter to thwarted connectedness) in terms of how managers assist employees presenting with suicide-related ideations in the workplace. To investigate this and develop a competency framework, we conducted qualitative interviews with 18 managers, drawing on existing interview protocols of critical incidents and behavioral event interviews for the elicitation of competencies. Competencies in adaptive performance (and particularly crisis management) emerged as important for facilitating managers' interactions with employees who may present with suicidality. This research provides a first step in developing resources to equip managers with the necessary competencies that are needed to deal with employees experiencing suicide-related ideations (i.e. perceived burdensomeness and thwarted connectedness). The framework is also useful as an initial step to support human resource development (HRD) professionals develop interventions such as training and/or mentoring programs for managers to address this very important issue.",
