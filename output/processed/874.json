    "Abstract": "An employer-based work-experience program run by a multinational organization temporarily employs people with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to prepare them for external employment. This study observes the impact of participation for people with ASD in establishing employment (with or without a competitive salary). A quasi-experimental design constructed a control group that can be considered similar to the group of participants in the employer-based program, except for supported-employment entitlement. Results indicate a 29% increase in post-five-year employment for participants than the control group, but no effect was found on employment with a competitive salary, only for the post-second year. Inclusivity enhances the careers of people with ASD, but their potential to establish employment with a competitive salary remains limited.",
