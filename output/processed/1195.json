    "Abstract": "Background. - The purpose of this research is to determine whether, in the Canadian workforce, cultural identity traits, particularly ethnicity and immigrant status, might modify the association of work with depressive symptoms.Method. - Data were derived from the nine cycles of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) conducted by Statistics Canada. Based on a sample of 6477 workers, multilevel regression models were brought into being. Analyses were adjusted for family-related factors, non-work social support, and personal characteristics.Results. - After accounting for potential confounders, ethnicity and work-related factors were distinctly and directly associated with depressive symptoms. Workers belonging to visible minorities had significantly fewer depressive symptoms than their Caucasian counterparts. Unlike Caucasians, they were more often overqualified, less in a position to use their skills, and largely without decision-making authority. On the other hand, all analyses having to do with immigrant status led to inconclusive results.Conclusion. - Ethnicity seems to have some bearing on the association of work with depressive symptoms among members of the Canadian workforce. It might be beneficial to carry out targeted interventions aimed at improving working conditions according to ethnicity and situations involving professional overqualification.
