    "Abstract": "Young adults who experience psychosis want to work but are less likely to be employed than their peers. Sixty two studies relating to young adults with psychosis and employment were reviewed following a systematic search of five databases: CINAHL, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, SCOPUS and EMBASE. Publication date ranged from 1973 to 2019 with > 70% between 2010 and 2019. Intervention was considered in 29 papers; critical appraisal revealed 90% of these had moderate to good methodological quality with only three RCTs. Of 11 intervention types Early Intervention  and Individual Placement and Support  were most common; both demonstrating positive impact on obtaining employment. The review identified minimal participant perspectives and great variability in: terminology used; the reporting of participant attributes; intervention characteristics and ways employment outcomes were measured. Employment processes identified were preparing for, seeking, obtaining, keeping and re-obtaining employment, with current research efforts focused on obtaining work. More focus is required on keeping and re-obtaining employment.",
