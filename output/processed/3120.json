    "Article Title": "Supervision for superheroes: the case for reflective professional supervision for senior doctors.",
    "Abstract": "The practice of medicine is inherently stressful with regular exposure to trauma and the distress of others. There is a culture in medicine that doctors should not be affected by such things, although it is well recognised that doctors have higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicide, and substance abuse than the general public. Reflective professional supervision is a forum where the complexities of the interpersonal interactions that underpin the provision of healthcare can be explored in a supportive and confidential setting. It is argued that this is a process that should continue for the duration of a doctor's career, with potential benefits including enhanced job satisfaction and resilience, better workplace communication and improved interpersonal skills.",

The intervention is reflective professional supervision, which is not directly related to employment services or job-related outcomes. The study's population is clearly defined as senior doctors, which does not align with the specified population of people with mental health disorders. The outcomes discussed are job satisfaction and resilience, which are not the employment or labor outcomes specified in the inclusion criteria.",
