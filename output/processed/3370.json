    "Abstract": "Australian teachers are increasingly experiencing high levels of workplace stress, anxiety, depression and burnout. This has led to calls for action to improve the wellbeing of Australian teachers. This mixed method study demonstrated that when teachers intentionally use four evidence-based positive psychology strategies for six weeks there were flow on effects in their wellbeing, teaching practice and students' learning. This included teachers reporting that they felt less stressed, more relaxed, more positive and more engaged with teaching. Teachers also reported becoming more student-centred in their classroom approach and focusing more on developing better relationships with their students. In addition, teachers perceived that their students were calmer in class, more engaged with learning and completed more work. This study reports statistically significant findings and has implications for future research and in informing changes to organisational and pedagogical practices which are supportive of teacher wellbeing.",
