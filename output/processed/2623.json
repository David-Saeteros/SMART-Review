    "Article Title": "Predictors of an Active Lifestyle in Middle-Aged and Older Adults with HIV in the United States South",
    "Abstract": "Background and Purpose: An active lifestyle is important for health maintenance and disease prevention. This study was to examine what factors predict an active lifestyle in HIV+ and HIV-adults from the United States Deep South.Methods: The sample included 279 participants (174 HIV+ and 105 HIV-) who completed a comprehensive assessment. An active lifestyle composite was created using variables of employment status, level of social support, level of physical activity, and diet. Correlations and regression analyses were conducted between the active lifestyle composite and possible predictors for all (HIV+ and HIV-), HIV+, and HIV-participants, respectively.Results: Lower levels of depression, higher socioeconomic status (SES), and younger age were significant predictors of a more active lifestyle for the full sample, HIV+, and HIV-participants, respectively.Conclusion: SES and depression represent important factors influencing engagement in an active lifestyle in PLWH. Such factors should be considered when developing and implementing lifestyle interventions.",
