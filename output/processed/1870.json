    "Abstract": "ObjectivesWorkplaces are suitable areas for smoking cessation programs and incentives. This study was carried out to determine the effectiveness of interventions in the workplace for smoking cessation in working individuals.MethodsAll studies published in English between 2013 and 2022 were searched in Pub Med, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases. Meta-analysis was based on PRISMA 2020. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO. A random effects model was applied to the meta-analysis processes, and Hedges' g was used to calculate the effect size.ResultsOf the included studies, 11 were randomized controlled trials, and 8 were cluster randomized controlled trials. In different working sectors, various interventions such as motivational/individual interviews, group counseling, telephone coaching, web-based training, mindfulness meditation, and financial interventions were implemented. These interventions were carried out alone or in combination with one or more other interventions. The interventions generally have short-term effects, and financial incentives or supports were the factors that positively motivate the interventions. The joint effect size of attempts to quit smoking in the workplace (Hedges' g) was 1.171. Heterogeneity between studies was significant (Q = 199.762, p = 0.015, I2 = 80.477%). No publication bias was detected.ConclusionsWe determined that smoking cessation interventions applied in the workplace have a large effect. We recommend that the long-term effects of increasing effectiveness of these interventions be considered and planned in line with the needs of working groups.",
