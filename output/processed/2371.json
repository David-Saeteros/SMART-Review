    "Article Title": "Factors Associated with Depression and Anxiety Symptoms among Migrant Population in Spain during the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "Abstract": "Migrants are likely to experience mental health conditions, being one of the most vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms and (2) examine the impact of risk and protective factors on this symptomatology. A sample of 129 migrants living in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic completed an anonymous online survey, including information on sociodemographic and individual characteristics, migration, basic needs, social environment and perceived health domains. Multiple Poisson regression models analysed the effects of risk and protective factors on depression and anxiety symptoms. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 22.3% and 21.4%, respectively. Risk factors such as living in a rented house and previous mental health conditions were associated with higher depression symptoms, whereas unemployment was related to anxiety symptoms. Conversely, older age, better self-esteem, and higher levels of social support were associated with fewer depression symptoms. Older age and better quality of life were related to fewer anxiety symptoms. These findings addressing risk and protective factors (e.g., social support, self-esteem) help to design culturally effective programs, particularly in migrants with pre-existing mental health conditions, adjusting the organisation of mental healthcare services in difficult times in Spain.",
