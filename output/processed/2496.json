    "Abstract": "ObjectivesThe primary objective of this study was to establish whether clinical depression and increased suicide risk differed between Australian fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) workers and their residential counterparts in the resources sector. We also sought to identify whether bullying and social support were associated with depression and suicide risk in this cohort.MethodsA cross-sectional survey design was used. Completed questionnaires were received from 751 respondents who were employed in the Australian resources sector. Primary outcomes were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale and Negative Acts Questionnaire - Revised. A general linear model was used to examine the association between depression, hopelessness and predictive factors.ResultsThe results of a general linear model analysis demonstrated that depression (partial eta(2) = 0.02; P = 0.01) and hopelessness (partial eta(2) = 0.02; P = 0.02) were significantly higher in residential than FIFO workers. In addition, bullying was significantly associated with higher levels of depression (partial eta(2) = 0.11; P = 0.001) and hopelessness (partial eta(2) = 0.04; P = 0.001). Finally, increased social support was significantly associated with lower depression rates (partial eta(2) = 0.13; P = 0.001) and hopelessness (partial eta(2) = 0.14; P = 0.001).ConclusionsInterventions should be delivered to reduce depression and hopelessness in Australian resource workers, particularly through addressing workplace bullying and enhancing social support.What is known about the topic?One-third of Australian resource workers experience psychosocial distress. Research examining factors that influence such distress is lacking.What does this paper add?The results of this study demonstrate that clinical depression and suicide risk were significantly higher in residential resource workers than in FIFO workers. Depression and suicide risk were directly associated with workplace bullying. In addition, social support was an important protective factor against depression and bullying in Australian FIFO and residential resource workers.",
