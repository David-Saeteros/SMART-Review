    "Abstract": "BackgroundTo determine the real world relapse rate in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) who had discontinued antipsychotic medication and identify socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with the risk of relapse.MethodsQuantitative data were obtained via case-note review on 63 patients with FEP who had discontinued antipsychotic medication from Birmingham Early Intervention Service between 2012 and 2015. The follow-up period was until either: an occurrence of a relapse; end of 12-month study period; end of patient's case-note record. Relapse was defined as a return of symptoms requiring one of the following: home treatment, hospital admission or was based on clinical teams' decision as having a relapse. A pro-forma targeted pre-defined socio-demographic and clinical factors. Survival analysis was undertaken to estimate the 12-month relapse rate following discontinuation of antipsychotics and Cox regression performed to identify relapse predictors.ResultsThe Kaplan-Meier 12-month relapse estimate was 67% (95% confidence interval, 54%, 80%). Significant factors (P < .05) independently associated with an increased risk of relapse following discontinuation of antipsychotic medication were: male gender, not being in education, employment or training (NEET) and number of previous psychiatric hospital admissions.ConclusionsRelapse is common after discontinuation of antipsychotic medication following recovery from a FEP. It is important that patients who wish to discontinue their medication are informed of the high relapse rates and the associated risks. Furthermore, male patients, patients with NEET status and those who have had previous hospital admissions may require closer monitoring.",
