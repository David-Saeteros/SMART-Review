    "Article Title": "The Effects of Social Support on Self-Esteem, Self-Efficacy, and Job Search Efficacy in the Unemployed",
    "Abstract": "This study attempted to determine the effects of family and social support on the self-esteem, self-efficacy, and job search self-efficacy of the unemployed. A total of 117 surveys were collected in Nevada, Idaho, and Oregon measuring self-esteem, general self-efficacy, and job search self-efficacy and social support. Pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated moderately strong positive relationships between social support and self-esteem, general self-efficacy, and job search self-efficacy. Social and family support had a stronger influence on the self-perceptions of men than women.",
