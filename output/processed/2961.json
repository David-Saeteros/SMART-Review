    "Article Title": "Predictors of Posttraumatic Growth Among Adult Tsunami Survivors: The Role of Employment, Religion, and Family Attributes",
    "Abstract": "This study examined the positive effects of trauma exposure among adult survivors of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and was guided by a bioecological framework. A total of 301 adults from India were assessed for posttraumatic growth and a set of demographic, individual, family, and social capital variables. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that religion, employment, family type, family flexibility, and family communication were significant predictors of posttraumatic growth. Contrary to expectations, individual factors and social capital did not contribute to posttraumatic growth. Findings imply that helping survivors make meaning out of their traumatic experience may facilitate posttraumatic growth. Intervention to promote increased employment opportunities and family resources is highly recommended for adult trauma survivors. Future trauma research should explore the role of perceived as well as actual familial and community resources, in addition to personal resources, in fostering posttraumatic growth.",
