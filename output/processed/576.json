    "Abstract": "The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore which variables were associated with physical inactivity in people living with HIV living in a fishing community in Uganda. Secondary aims were to explore the reasons for and barriers to physical activity (PA). Two hundred and fifty-six individuals living with HIV (77 men, 40.5 +/- 10.3 years) completed the Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Women had a 1.62 (95% CI = 1.01-2.57), those not having a job a 2.81 (95% CI = 2.00-3.94), and those with depression a 5.67 (95% CI = 2.27-14.17) higher odds for not being physically active for 150 min/week at moderate intensity. Employment and depression status were the only independent significant predictors explaining 27.2% of the PAVS variance. Becoming more healthy and energetic again and reducing stress were the most important PA motives, and musculoskeletal pain, body weakness, and lack of time were the most important PA barriers.",
