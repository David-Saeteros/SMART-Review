    "Abstract": "Introduction Health care providers face heightened stress and increased rates of anxiety and depression post-COVID-19. The pandemic, officially declared over in May 2023, continues to impact their wellbeing significantly, with ongoing mental health monitoring and tailored interventions crucial for support.Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of job stressors in a sample of Spanish health care providers post-COVID and to explore potential differences between physicians and nurses, hypothesizing that while both professional categories could experience similar job stressors, some of them could have a differential impact on the mental health of each subgroup.Methods This cross-sectional substudy is part of the MINDxYOU project. The data were collected from 191 health care providers from two regions in Spain. Participants completed the UNIPSICO test battery, used to assess job stressors, and questionnaires to evaluate perceived stress, depressive symptomatology, anxiety, and resilience. Descriptive analyses, bivariate correlations, and linear regression models were performed to compare the two professions that were the most representative of our sample: physicians (n = 82) and nurses (n = 54).Results The most frequent job stressors were workload, lack of positive feedback, and inequity in social interactions. Physicians reported worse outcomes in terms of workload, autonomy, role conflicts, inequity in social interactions, and work-family balance compared to nurses. Mobbing, despite not being very frequent, significantly predicted different mental health outcomes for both physicians and nurses. Inequity in social interactions and job satisfaction were significant predictors of physicians' mental health, while role ambiguity, interpersonal conflicts, and career turnover intentions predicted nurses' mental health.Conclusion As hypothesized, our findings highlight that certain job stressors (i.e., inequity in social interactions, conflicts in the workplace) might be affecting physicians' and nurses' mental health differently. Therefore, effective strategies addressing each subgroup's specific stressors would be necessary to prevent the development of burnout syndrome and other serious mental health conditions associated with occupational stress. These strategies would imply organizational changes in most cases.",
