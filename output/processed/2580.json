    "Abstract": "Background Working in healthcare can entail intense emotional demands that increases susceptibility to occupational risk factors. Psychosocial risk assessment can contribute to promoting awareness of the effects of work on positive mental health.Aims To explore and analyse the influence of psychosocial work factors on positive mental health among psychologists.Methods A cross-sectional study of 339 psychologists was conducted. Two instruments were used for data collection: the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) to assess well-being and the Health and Work Survey (INSAT) to assess psychosocial work factors.Results This study identified psychosocial work factors that affect psychologists' positive mental health, namely, emotional well-being was affected by 'Need help from colleagues' (beta = -1.091), 'Have no one I can trust' (beta = -1.253) and 'Complex work' (beta = 0.751); psychological well-being was affected by 'Intense work pace' (beta = 1.151), 'Not able to participate in decisions' (beta = -3.695) and 'Complex work' (beta = 1.520); and social well-being was affected by 'Always changing roles and tasks' (beta = -1.810) and 'Not able to participate in decisions' (beta = -2.470).Conclusions Psychosocial work factors such as work organization, work relationships and emotional demands influence psychologists' positive mental health. Social support at the workplace and having challenging and autonomous work can promote mental health. It is important to develop better organizational practices to promote mental health and well-being among these professionals.",
