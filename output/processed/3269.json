    "Article Title": "Potentially Traumatic Events and Job Satisfaction A Prospective Population-Based Comparative Study",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of potentially traumatic events (PTEs), posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and coping self-efficacy (CSE) on post-event job satisfaction. Methods: Repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess differences in the course of job satisfaction during 1 year between population-based samples of affected and nonaffected workers. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted with pre-event health, job satisfaction and insecurity, and post-event PTSS and CSE as predictors. Results: About 16% of the affected workers had probable PTSD. The course of job satisfaction between affected (n = 123) and nonaffected workers (n = 644) did not differ significantly. PTSS and CSE did not independently predict post-event satisfaction, in contrast to pre-event job satisfaction. Conclusion: Findings suggest that when needed social support is provided, concerns about the negative effects of potentially traumatic events on job satisfaction could be somewhat relaxed.",
