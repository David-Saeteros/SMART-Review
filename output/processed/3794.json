    "Abstract": "Introduction: Individuals experiencing housing instability face significant health inequities. Addressing housing instability requires an understanding of the factors that contribute to these inequities-a responsibility that has been assumed by community-based organizations. Interviewing individuals from 3 Canadian provinces, the present study aimed to examine the perspectives of individuals from front-line services of the social determinants of health (SDoH) needs of individuals experiencing housing instability.Methods: As part of a larger knowledge translation study, we conducted 8 semi-structured interviews with individuals from front-line services (eg, shelter workers and shelter mental health nurses) in Canada (Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta) and used thematic analysis to identify predominant unmet SDoH needs.Results: Individuals from front-line services discussed the roles of many SDoH that may perpetuate housing instability in their clients. These included: (1) limited social supports; (2) poor access to health services; (3) poor opportunities for income and employment; (4) lack of transportation; (5) gender-based discrimination; (6) race-based discrimination; and (7) limited access to education and limited literacy skills.Conclusion: This study reveals how front-line service providers observe SDoH factors contributing to housing instability and create barriers to accessing support services. They advocate for a multi-system approach to addressing intersecting SDoH factors to validate clients' experiences and help them achieve stable housing. Additionally, more research and consultation with front-line providers are necessary to understand and overcome systemic barriers to stable housing.",
