    "Abstract": "Aims and objectivesTo understand the relation between the experience of violence and sociodemographic and clinical factors, and to determine whether diagnosed depression and the presence of anxiety and stress are related to having experienced workplace and domestic violence in different genders and age groups.BackgroundPrevious studies indicate that domestic and workplace violence increase the risk of suffering from depression. However, no studies have evaluated these two types of violence in a same cohort.Design and methodsWe designed a descriptive cross-sectional study from 317 individuals randomly selected from the population in southern Catalonia (Spain). Sociodemographic and Goldberg anxiety-depression questionnaires were administered by telephone survey to 160 men and 157 women in December 2008. The data obtained were analysed by a logistic regression model.ResultsA quarter of the individuals had suffered from violence: 4829% of them had experienced domestic violence and 329% had experienced workplace violence. Nearly half of the individuals with depression had experienced violence. No statistical difference has been observed between domestic and workplace violence regarding diagnosed depression. Women were twice as likely as men to have suffered from violence. People working outside their home and those who claimed to have no social support had a greater risk of suffering from violence. A greater consumption of medication, above all of psychotropic drugs, is associated with experiencing violence and with greater comorbidity. Predictive factors for suffering from depression are being women, having experienced violence, having suffered stress or anxiety, having little or no social support, having overload of task or having no secondary education and no tertiary education.ConclusionsThis study suggests that when considering depression, anxiety and stress, especially in women, we must take into account whether an individual has suffered violence.Relevance to clinical practiceIdentifying violence can help health professionals, managers and researchers improve care and reduce suffering in families and communities.",
