    "Article Title": "Protocol of a Community-Based Intervention on Mental Health in Kashmir",
    "Abstract": "Introduction:Mental health issues are on an exponential rise in Kashmir due to varied reasons including political instability, eco fragility, the growing lag in the provision of education and employment, and several other reasons. Impediments such as the overwhelming stigma and the cultural sensitivity associated with mental health issues both sustain and perpetuate mental ill health and also prevent any treatment and rehabilitation. This article describes the protocol of a research project, funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, which aims to address this issue.Aim:To screen the population for mental health issues and to provide community-based intervention for the identified cases also to train community health workers for sustainable mental health support.Methods:We will conduct a household survey using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) for the identification of the clients. A multi-stage random sampling shall be used to select the villages and the households from the marginalized communities. A sample of 500 respondents shall be screened using HSCL-25. Those who screen positive for mental health issues will be offered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) by a qualified clinical psychologist. The research will be able to address the diagnosis of depression and anxiety-related cases and the subsequent intervention. Additionally, we will utilize the facilitator's manual for Mental Health Training Program for Community Health Workers to build sustainable mental health services in community settings.Discussion:The study shall present a roadmap focusing on the indispensability of a comprehensive community-based intervention on mental health utilizing a non-pharmacological method. Assessing and analyzing the dynamics of mental health illness first hand, the study shall move ahead to offer a culturally tailored counseling program at the community level. The study also aims to highlight the role of the indigenous human resource (community health workers) and how its participation leads to a more scientific and sustainable intervention for more effective results, with an increased level of awareness and sensitization in a conventional society like Kashmir.",
