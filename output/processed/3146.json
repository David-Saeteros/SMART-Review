    "Article Title": "Impact of Telecommuting on Work-Family Conflict and Attitudes Among Greek Employees in Some Service Industries; Based on Working Restrictions During COVID-19",
    "Abstract": "Telecommuting can be a necessary and excellent means of maintaining work activity in emergencies such as the corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when a physical workplace is unfeasible. However, it may exacerbate work-family interfaces, burden daily personal life, and negatively affect employees' mental health. This study explored how telecommuting relates to work-family conflict during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the data of 836 managers and employees from three major service sectors: tourism, public services, and retail. Relationships among variables were evaluated using linear regression. Based on the results, telecommuting violates the boundaries of work and family life.",
