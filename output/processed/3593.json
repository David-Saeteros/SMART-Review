    "Article Title": "Living situation and perceived parental financial support as protective factors against financial strain among Australian university students",
    "Abstract": "Objective: This study examines how differences among young adults' residential arrangements and parental support are related to variation in university students' financial and psychological well-being. Method: Six-hundred four students completed an online survey about financial experiences and support, and well-being. Students were split into four groups depending on their living situation and perceptions of adequate parental support. A multi-groups approach tested test path differences among the groups. Results: Living at home with parents combined with perceiving lower parental financial support was associated with lower financial strain and higher psychological well-being, compared with reporting higher financial support when living at home, and living out of home regardless of support (p < .001). For students living outside of the parental home and perceiving inadequate parental financial support, economising was most strongly associated with perceived financial strain (p < .05), which in turn most strongly predicted lower well-being (p < .05). Conclusions: It is suggested that the non-monetary assistance provided by remaining in the family home nullifies the protective benefits of perceiving adequate parental financial support; however, when living away from the parental home, perceiving adequate parental financial support can buffer negative effects of financial strain on well-being.",
