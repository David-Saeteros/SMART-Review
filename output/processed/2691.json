    "Abstract": "African American women experience higher rates of HIV than other women in the United States, and stigma has been identified as an important determinant of engagement in HIV care. Our study examined whether key variables moderated the effect of an anti-stigma intervention on outcomes among African American women receiving treatment for HIV. Twelve potential moderators included: age, years lived with HIV, marital status, employment status, education level, PTSD diagnosis, alcohol use, social support, baseline CD4 count, baseline viral load, and number of children. Outcomes included changes in: HIV-related stigma, social support, depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, alcohol use, viral load, and engagement in HIV care. Results suggest that the intervention is associated with greater improvement in engagement in care among participants with PTSD or depression at baseline, and may help maintain engagement in care among participants experiencing certain mental health conditions. This provides opportunities to address discriminatory structural barriers that lead to stigma and drop-offs in HIV care.",
