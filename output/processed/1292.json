    "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic disorder requiring long-lasting and comprehensive treatment. Because of this disorder patients are socially isolated. Consequently, schizophrenia has a significant economic burden both in a group of direct and indirect costs. The aim was to analyse experts' opinions in the field of psychiatry concerning work possibilities among people with schizophrenia and to present the importance of employment for more effective treatment. A worldwide study was conducted between June 2011 and June 2013 using a questionnaire consisting of six open-closed questions and a short metrics. The questionnaire was delivered to experts and spread all over the world by post and via the internet. Over 3000 questionnaires were sent and the addressed specialists were requested to return them. From received 403 questionnaires 320 were included into the study, based on adopted inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although patients are afraid of looking for a job, respondents indicated that they crave for employment. The number of people that are able to work during remission of schizophrenia is considerably higher (50.35 %) than the number of actually employed (15.85 %). Non-pharmacological therapies were indicated as important to improve patients' chances of finding a job during remission of schizophrenia. The number of people that can work during remission of schizophrenia is considerably higher than the number of affected people employed. Patients crave for a job and supported employment should be treated as priority by health-care decision makers.",
