    "Article Title": "Reliability of Health Professionals' Perceptions of Employment for People with Severe Mental Illness",
    "Abstract": "The aim was to assess the initial psychometric properties of a survey designed to measure health professionals' perceptions of an integrated supported employment program as a contributor to recovery from severe mental illness. Thirty four mental health professionals with a mean age of 44.4 years completed the survey at two time points, mean 50 days apart. The Health Professionals Perceptions of Employment Scale had good face validity, respondent acceptability, test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Two questions were removed as a result of these findings. The revised version is now available on request. The revised HPPE is an acceptable, reliable, and promising tool for monitoring the integration of a mental health service with an evidence-based supported employment program.",
