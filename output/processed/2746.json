    "Abstract": "Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has posed new challenges to actors in vocational rehabilitation (VR) for people with disabilities. In this study, we were interested in the following: How did actors like service providers and financers of VR (here: German Federal Employment Agency (FEA)) experience the Covid-19 pandemic, which process changes and delays have occurred, and what impact will this possibly have on the future of vocational rehabilitation for people with disabilities? Methods Between July 2020 und July 2021, a total of 29 persons from service providers of VR programs (n=16) and representatives of the FEA (n=8) were asked about their experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic in the course of 24 guided expert interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded in MAXQDA; the analyses of the transcribed material are based on a system developed from inductive and deductive categories. Results VR programs had to be conducted remotely, digital possibilities had to be created. As a result, VR was also forced to evolve technologically, revealing opportunities (in the provision of programs) and limitations (e. g. acquisition of social skills or assessment of mental health). Thus, continuous additional support by the service providers was indispensable to contain psychological crises, to ensure the understanding of the program contents and to avoid dropouts. Just like schools, the employment agencies and job centers closed their doors for a long time and VR and general vocational counseling did not take place nor did assessment procedures carried out at the medical and psychological services of the FEA for determining VR needs. A decline in access to VR had been apparent for some time, but it became increasingly evident, particularly for 2021/22. Individuals from poor households were more likely to be affected because they were more difficult to keep in touch with. Conclusion Even though VR has experienced a major digital boost, experience from the pandemic has shown that programs in face-to-face formats with social contact are particularly important for young people and people with mental disabilities. Nevertheless, VR must change with the working environment in order to prevent people with disabilities from being left behind even further.",
