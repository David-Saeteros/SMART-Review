    "Article Title": "Spontaneous Participation in Secondary Prevention Programs: The Role of Psychosocial Predictors",
    "Abstract": "Disease prevention is a multifaceted construct that has been widely studied. Nevertheless, in spite of its importance, it is still not sufficiently considered by the general population. Since the reasons for this lack of consideration are not yet fully understood, we created an Online Prevention Survey (OPS) to investigate the role of both sociodemographic and psychological factors in predicting individuals' spontaneous participation in secondary prevention programs. The results revealed that younger people, men, manual workers, unemployed people, and those who do not regularly practise physical activity were less likely to spontaneously participate in such programs. Furthermore, an analysis of the psychological determinants of the willingness to participate in secondary prevention programs showed that depressive symptoms negatively predict it, while an individual's perception of receiving high social support acts as a positive predictor. Based on these results, we suggest the need for implementing new tailored approaches to promote prevention initiatives to those segments of the population which are more reluctant to spontaneously undertake prevention paths.",
