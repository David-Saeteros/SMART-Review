    "Abstract": "BackgroundTeam cohesion is a crucial factor when it comes to job satisfaction and turnovers. However, in Germany, economic measures for team cohesion are scarce. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an economic self-report questionnaire for measuring team cohesion in a work setting in health care.MethodsThe questionnaire was developed in a stepwise procedure. After item analysis, exploratory factor analysis was conducted to assess factor structure. Reliability was tested via internal consistency. To assess convergent and divergent validity, we applied the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ), the Perceived Cohesion Scale (PCS), the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI), the Effort-Reward Imbalance Scale (ERI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), respectively.ResultsThe pilot version was tested in a sample of n = 126 adult nurses. Item analysis resulted in a total of 13 items for the final version. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a two-factor structure. Internal consistency for the two subscales was good, with alpha = 0.88 and alpha = 0.84, respectively. Convergent validity with the subscales of COPSOQ and PCS was moderate to high (r =.26- r =.64). For divergent validity, correlations with the ESSI were low (r =.01- r = -.09). We further found significant correlations with depression symptoms (r=-.22- r=-.37), as well as reward (ERI) (r =.41 -r =.47) and effort (ERI) (r=-.20 - r = -.24).ConclusionsWe developed and validated the Erlangen Team Cohesion at Work Scale (ETC), a self-report measure for team cohesion with very good psychometric properties. Due to its economic deployment, it is suitable for measuring team cohesion in work settings, especially in health care.",
