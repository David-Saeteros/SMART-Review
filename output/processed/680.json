    "Article Title": "Prevention of depression. Approaches, evidence and examples of good practice",
    "Abstract": "Whereas much has already been done for the treatment of depressive disorders, the options for their prevention are only gradually perceived. Over the last few years a comprehensive evidence base on the effectiveness of preventive interventions has been developed. In addition, more is known about which target groups benefit from specific preventive measures. This article gives an overview on the possibilities for prevention of depression in relation to single target groups and supports these with examples of good practice.",
