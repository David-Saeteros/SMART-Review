    "Article Title": "Investigating the Feasibility of Using a Wearable Device to Measure Physiologic Health Data in Emergency Nurses and Residents: Observational Cohort Study",
    "Abstract": "Background: Emergency departments play a pivotal role in the US health care system, with high use rates and inherent stress placed on patients, patient care, and clinicians. The impact of the emergency department environment on the health and well-being of emergency residents and nurses can be seen in worsening rates of burnout and cardiovascular health. Research on clinician health has historically been completed outside of clinical areas and not personalized to the individual. The expansion of digital technology, specifically wearable devices, may enhance the ability to understand how health care environments impact clinicians. Objective: The primary objective of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using wearable devices to measure and record physiologic data from emergency nurses and resident physicians. Understanding strategies that are accepted and used by clinicians is critical prior to launching larger investigations aimed at improving outcomes. Methods: This was a longitudinal pilot study conducted at an academic, urban, level 1 trauma center. A total of 20 participants, including emergency medicine resident physicians and nurses, were equipped with a wearable device (WHOOP band) and access to a mobile health platform for 6 weeks. Baseline surveys assessed burnout, mental health, and expectations of the device and experience. Participants provided open-ended feedback on the device and platform, contributing to the assessment of acceptance, adoption, and use of the wearable device. Secondary measures explored early signs and variations in heart rate variability, sleep, Results: Of the 20 participants, 10 consistently used the wearable device. Feedback highlighted varying experiences with the device, with a preference for more common wearables like the Apple Watch or Fitbit. Resident physicians demonstrated higher engagement with the device and platform as compared with nurses. Baseline mental health assessments indicated mild anxiety and depressive symptoms among participants. The Professional Fulfillment Index revealed low professional fulfillment, moderate workplace exhaustion, and interpersonal disengagement. Conclusions: This pilot study underscores the potential of wearable devices in monitoring emergency clinicians' physiologic data but reveals challenges related to device preferences and engagement. The key takeaway is the necessity to optimize device and platform design for clinician use. Larger, randomized trials are recommended to further explore and refine strategies for leveraging wearable technology to support the well-being of the emergency workforce.",
