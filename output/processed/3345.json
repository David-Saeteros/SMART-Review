    "Article Title": "Clinical psychologists' perceptions of telephone consultation for low-income patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: an interview study",
    "Abstract": "Aims: We will examine the processes of change in psychological practice that have been altered by the lockdown. Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, low-income populations, notably residents of social homes or shelters, were shown to be particularly susceptible to contagion. During lockdown, telephone-based psychological consultations became the norm. Methods: In this qualitative research, we carried out semi-structured interviews with 10 psychologists working in social homes or shelters. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Data were studied using consensus qualitative research. Findings: During lockdown, participants felt that isolation increased while medical and social support decreased. Psychologists had to adapt their work methods and work more closely with on-site staffs. After lockdown, there was an increase in mental health issues. Participants perceived that telephone consulting seemed to facilitate access to psychological help. Although psychologists have quickly adapted, a decrease in the quality of clinical work was a general assessment. Results stress the necessity to train French psychologists in telemental health practices.",
