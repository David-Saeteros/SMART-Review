    "Article Title": "High-performance HR practices, job demands and employee well-being: The moderating role of managerial support",
    "Abstract": "Drawing on the labour process theory and the job-demands resources model, this study challenges the assumption of beneficial effects of high-performance HR practices (HPHRP). The study argues that such practices lead to heightened work demands, which in turn compromise employees' well-being. The study also argues that the negative consequences associated with HPHRP can be ameliorated when employees receive support from their managers. To test the study's moderated mediation model, multisource matched employer-employee data from the Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2011 is used. Results of generalised multilevel structural equation modelling in STATA revealed that the relationship between HPHRP and well-being (anxiety and depression) is mediated by Job demands (JD). Furthermore, the relationship between JD and both anxiety and depression is moderated by Managerial support (MS), such that when the level of MS is high, the positive relationship between HPHRP and both anxiety and depression via JD is weaker. Taken together, the findings of the study advance our understanding of why and when HPHRP may impair employees' well-being.",
