    "Article Title": "Heart Failure Beyond the Diagnosis: A Narrative Review of Patients' Perspectives on Daily Life and Challenges",
    "Abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome that significantly affects patients' physical, psychological, and socioeconomic well-being. Despite advances in guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and SGLT2 inhibitors, HF continues to have a high global burden, with over 64 million affected worldwide and a five-year mortality rate of 50%. HF disrupts various life aspects, especially for younger patients (aged 35-55), who often face career interruptions due to severe symptoms like fatigue and frequent hospitalizations. These patients may struggle to maintain employment, resulting in financial instability compounded by high healthcare costs. Moreover, reduced exercise capacity and sexual dysfunction negatively impact patients' quality of life. The psychological toll of HF is profound, with many patients experiencing depression, anxiety, and stress. However, a positive mindset has been shown to improve survival rates, underscoring the need for holistic management approaches. Interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and remote monitoring technologies such as CardioMEMS offer promising avenues to improve quality of life and reduce hospitalizations. This review highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach to HF management. Tailoring care to align with individual goals, integrating psychosocial support, and enhancing patient education are vital in addressing both the clinical and personal challenges of HF. By adopting a comprehensive approach, healthcare providers can significantly improve long-term outcomes and quality of life for HF patients.",
