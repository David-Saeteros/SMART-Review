    "Article Title": "Education and Employment Needs and Receipt of Services in Community and Inpatient Mental Health Settings",
    "Abstract": "The interRAI Education and Employment Clinical Assessment Protocol (EdEmp CAP) identifies three groups of individuals in community and inpatient mental health settings: those who are at risk of losing their employment or disrupting their education; those who require support in employment or educational participation; or those for whom interventions related to education and employment are not triggered. The EdEmp CAP was effective in identifying subpopulations who were at risk, but who did not receive any vocational rehabilitation or counseling. The EdEmp CAP can be used in clinical practice to identify individuals who might benefit from specific interventions in these areas.",
