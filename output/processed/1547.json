    "Abstract": "Background: This review synthesizes evidence from etiologic and intervention studies of workplace-related determinants of mental health in workers in food and bar workers in the hospitality industry in Western high-income countries. Methods: Peer-reviewed literature published between January 2000 and August 2023 was gathered from five bibliographic databases. Any study design was eligible. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tools for appraisal. Results: A narrative analysis was conducted for 26 included studies (total n = 15,069 participants) across Australia (3), Ireland (1), Norway (1), Spain (2), the United States (17) and the United Kingdom (2). Individual and task-related factors such as high emotional job demands and low job control were associated with high burnout and depression. Uncivil and hostile interpersonal interactions with customers, management, and colleagues were found to contribute to poor mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and burnout. Conclusion: Findings from included studies highlight the impact of workplace culture, including management practices and workplace social support, on mental health. Organization-level interventions may therefore be most effective for addressing individual, interpersonal, and organizational determinants of mental health in food and bar occupations, particularly when implemented as part of broader organizational efforts to support health and wellbeing. Industry-wide policy changes may also be necessary to address structural concerns, including job and financial insecurity, job strain and access to benefits, such as secure sick leave and minimum contract hours.",
