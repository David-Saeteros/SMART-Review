    "Article Title": "Psychology of working counseling framework applied to a gender diverse restaurant worker during COVID-19",
    "Abstract": "Blustein's psychology of working counseling (PWC) framework provides a foundation for contextualizing needs of gender diverse individuals within a turbulent employment landscape. Given the impact of COVID-19 on the restaurant industry, many are navigating financial instability and challenges maintaining mental and physical health. The presented clinical case is situated in the context of restaurant work during a pandemic and incorporates considerations of intersecting identities including gender identity, class, and mental health. This article also provides interventions and professional development strategies based on PWC that career counselors can adapt to their own gender diverse clients in the restaurant industry.",
