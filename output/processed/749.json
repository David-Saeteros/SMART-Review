    "Abstract": "Objective: Learning collaboratives aim to improve the quality and outcomes of health care. This paper updates the Johnson & Johnson Dartmouth Community Mental Health Program, a 12-year learning collaborative on supported employment for people with mental illness. Methods: We gathered data from quarterly employment reports, monthly Individual Placement and Support (IPS) meetings, and presentations at the 2013 annual meeting of the learning collaborative. Results: The number of participant states or regions (and sites within these jurisdictions) was expanded to 16 jurisdictions in the United States and 3 in European countries. The quarterly rate of competitive employment has averaged 43% over 11 years in the U.S. sites. The collaborative has spawned numerous interactions, trainings, innovations, and research projects. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Long-term learning collaboratives can produce high quality services, good outcomes, sustainability, and innovation.",
