    "Abstract": "Objectives Recent studies have challenged the assumption that families are invariable sources of support for cancer caregivers, noting that relationships with family members can have both positive and negative effects on caregiver well-being. This study expands upon prior literature to examine the relationship between cancer caregivers' perceptions of the quality of their family interactions and their symptoms of anxiety.Methods We employed secondary analysis of baseline data from a multisite randomized clinical trial of an intervention for cancer caregivers conducted at 3 large academic palliative care clinics. We performed linear regression analyses to analyze the relationship between caregivers' perceptions of the quality of their family interactions and their symptoms of anxiety; additional models were estimated to further characterize this relationship with the addition of relevant covariates: race, ethnicity, sex, marital/relationship status, relationship to patient, employment status, household income, and perceived social support received from friends and significant others. We also conducted a sub-analysis of data provided by caregivers who were married or partnered to examine the relationship between their perceptions of the quality of their family interactions and their symptoms of anxiety with relationship satisfaction as a covariate.Results Among our analytic sample (n = 244), we identified a significant negative relationship between cancer caregivers' perceptions of the quality of their family interactions and their symptoms of anxiety; this relationship remained statistically significant with the addition of covariates. Relationship satisfaction was not found to be a statistically significant covariate in our sub-analysis of married or partnered caregivers.Significance of results Study results provide strong support for the development, testing, and implementation of interventions to improve family interactions as a strategy to reduce caregiver anxiety.",
