    "Article Title": "Stressed Out: Predictors of Depression Among Jail Officers and Deputies",
    "Abstract": "Prevalence and predictors of depression, a debilitating medical illness, are unknown among officers working in jails. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with jail officers at four facilities, utilizing age, ethnicity, gender, musculoskeletal back disorder, global physical health and mental health, and psychological well-being as predictor variables. Descriptive analyses detailed prevalence, and hierarchical regression models identified depression predictors. The prevalence of depression among jail officers was high and strongly influenced by job burnout over and above other health indicators. Mitigation of workplace stressors and identification of targeted interventions are needed to reduce risks for depression among jail officers.",
