    "Abstract": "Refugee youth face unique challenges in the resettlement context in Australia, which influence their wellbeing. Poor wellbeing affects individuals, and their family, friends, and the wider community. Little research exists on the relationship between wellbeing and the agency of African refugee youth in the resettlement process. This study examines factors associated with wellbeing to understand how refugee youth navigate resettlement through involvement in community activities. Despite the challenges of resettlement, study participants reported enhanced wellbeing because of community participation in various domains including education and community organisations. Refugee youth perceived themselves as agents of change and took ownership of their settlement journey by developing strategies to improve their own lives, while also supporting their peers. Study participants recognised the transformative role of education and the need for increased employment opportunities. To improve such outcomes, more integrated refugee resettlement approaches are required which recognise the agency of refugee youth and include them on their own terms.",
