    "Abstract": "Purpose To identify predictors of community-based employment and employment quality for young adults ages 23-30 with intellectual disability and co-occurring mental health conditions (YA-ID-MH). Methods We conducted secondary analysis of the 2017-2018 National Core Indicators(R) (NCI(R)) In-Person Survey. The NCI(R) survey was conducted in 35 states and Washington DC. Participants: YA with ID, ages 23-30 who had complete data. We conducted multiple regression analyses to examine demographic and environmental predictors of community-based employment, in addition to employment quality indicators: hourly wages, hours worked, and job duration. We also descriptively examined job satisfaction. Results YA-ID-MH were somewhat less likely to be employed per record review and self-report than YA with ID only, but these findings did not reach statistical significance. On average, YA with ID only had higher hourly wages and worked more hours than those with ID-MH, but there were no significant differences in job duration. For YA-ID-MH, predictors of employment included gender, race, level of ID, and residential setting. Multiple demographic and environmental factors predicted employment quality. Conclusions YA-ID-MH experience employment disparities compared to YA with ID only. Service providers should specifically attend to those at the highest risk of unemployment/low quality employment.",
