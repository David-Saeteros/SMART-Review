    "Abstract": "Purpose of review The steady rise in number of youth diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has led to the need to examine transition of care considerations specific to ASD. Improved understanding and guidance addressing these needs will allow pediatric and adult providers to work together to optimize social, medical, and occupational outcomes for these patients. Recent findings Health-care transition is a delicate time when children with ASD outgrow the services of pediatric programs and enter a fragmented healthcare system that is unfamiliar, insufficiently knowledgeable, and underfunded for their needs. Increasing autism prevalence and an aging population with autism lend urgency to improve outcomes in children transitioning to adult-care. Research reveals poor consequences in social support, education, vocational training and employment, housing, and healthcare. Specific considerations to address these issues and ensure successful transition from pediatric to adult care are needed.",
