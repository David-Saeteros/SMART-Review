    "Abstract": "Lay Abstract The persistent nature of Autism spectrum disorder, the high comorbidity with other disabilities or psychopathologies, and the added intensity of treatments and interventions can take a toll on parents of children with autism. Parents are also faced with higher risks of unemployment, divorce, and poorer mental health than parents of children with other disorders. Such parenting stress can be further exacerbated by cultural and environmental factors such as the more conservative and collectivistic Asian values. This review aimed to find and synthesize all qualitative evidence pertaining to the parenting experiences and needs of Asian primary caregivers of children with autism. The findings provided insight to parents' personal parenting journey; their adaptation and coping strategies, perception of family, community, and social support received; their experiences with healthcare, education, and social services; their future hopes for their children; and the unique parenting experiences of immigrants. Apart from highlighting the different cultural influence of parenting a child with autism in the Asian and Western context, the review has also revealed Asian parental needs for increased availability and accessibility to autism-related information, well-trained healthcare professionals and educators, a more holistic and inclusive education system, a need to further increase the public's awareness of autism, and culturally sensitive services. Therefore, it is necessary for healthcare and education providers to adopt a culturally sensitive approach or develop culturally tailored supportive programs to provide this group of Asian parents with adequate emotional and informational support that increases their parenting self-efficacy and alleviate their parenting stress.",
