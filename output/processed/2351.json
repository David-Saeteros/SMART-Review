    "Article Title": "The Effects of Legal Status on Employment and Health Outcomes among Low-Skilled Chinese Immigrants in New York City",
    "Abstract": "Using a 2004 survey done in New York City's Chinese community, we explore the extent to which legal status affects immigrants' labor market performance and health status. We focus on five issues related to legal status of immigrants: wages, weekly working hours, employment location, self-rated health, and health care utilization. Our results show that undocumented immigrants are more likely to work for exceptionally long hours and are less likely to see a doctor when they get sick. However, we also find that current legal status does not have a significant effect on current health status. This work contributes to a growing literature on how legal status is linked to labor market and health consequences.",

Additionally, the population is not specifically defined as people with mental health disorders.",
