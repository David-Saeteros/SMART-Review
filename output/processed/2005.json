    "Abstract": "BackgroundThere has been increasing interest on interventions addressing developmental transitions for youth with mental health disorders.ObjectiveThe purpose of the current study was to conduct an updated scoping review of a 2016 paper that describes evaluated programs or interventions addressing developmental transitions for youth with mental health disorders.MethodsInclusion criteria included: publication in English between January 2013 to February 2020; included a sample between 12 and 25 years and with a mental health disorder (developmental disorders, psychotic disorders, and substance abuse disorders); described health programs and interventions that address developmental aspects of the transition to adulthood; and had reported outcome evaluations. A systematic search of databases resulted in 5738 articles identified, 3398 included for title and abstract review, and full-text review of 341 articles, with 46 meeting our inclusion criteria.ResultsOverall, the current review suggests that there has been a strong emergence of interventions targeting developmental transitions for youth with mental health disorders. Although much effort has continued to focus on youth with neurodevelopmental disorders, more interventions have since been developed for youth with mental illness and substance use disorders.ConclusionsThe current review further summarizes how these interventions are being delivered to youth during their transition into emerging adulthood, with the aim of helping practitioners and policymakers develop improved evidence-based programs related to developmental transitions.",
