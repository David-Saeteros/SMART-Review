    "Article Title": "Working conditions and occupational stress among nurses in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional pilot study",
    "Abstract": "Background Occupational stress is common among nurses and is thought to be one of the key factors for the global shortages of nurses. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been done to assess occupational stress among Bangladeshi nurses. This study aimed to investigate the association of sociodemographic characteristics and occupational characteristics with stress experienced by nurses working in a specialized hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional study design was employed involving 155 nurses working in the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease (NICVD). Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire with the Bengali version of the Occupational Stress Index (OSI). Both univariate (Student t-test or ANOVA) and multivariate analyses (linear regression) were performed to identify the sociodemographic and work-related factors associated with occupational stress. Results The average score on the OSI was 147.1 - moderate level of occupational stress among nurses. The OSI score was higher in males (150.25) than in females (143.94). Nurses who were aged >40 years, and single, had nursing experience between 10 and 20 years and were considering promotion tended to suffer more stress than their peers. Findings from linear regression showed that the OSI score was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with the work conditions: role overload, role ambiguity, role conflict, responsibility, support from colleagues and rational coping. Conclusion The findings indicated the importance of occupational characteristics in relation to occupational stress among nurses. Further results of this study can be utilized by researchers and policymakers to guide preventative measures to reduce occupational stress among nurses.",
