    "Article Title": "Collaborative Learning: A Qualitative Study Exploring Factors Contributing to a Successful Tobacco Cessation Train-the-Trainer Program as a Community of Practice",
    "Abstract": "Individuals with behavioral health conditions account for 50% of annual smoking-related deaths, yet rarely receive tobacco dependence treatment within local mental health authorities (LMHAs). As lack of training and knowledge are key barriers to providing tobacco dependence treatment, Taking Texas Tobacco-Free (TTTF) developed an iterative, 4-6-months train-the-trainer program to embed expertise and delivery of sustained education on tobacco-free workplace policies and practices in participating centers. We explore the employee champions' train-the-trainer program experiences using a community of practice (CoP) model to identify key contributors to successful program implementation. Across 3 different LMHAs, we conducted semi-structured individual and group interviews online at 2 time points. We interviewed each champion twice (except for 1 champion who dropped out between measurements); pre-implementation (3 group interviews; N = 4 + 4 + 3 = 11 champions); post-implementation (7 individual interviews and 1 group interview; 7 + 3 = 10 champions). Therefore, 11 champions participated in pre- and post-implementation interviews from July 2020-May 2021. Guided by an iterative, thematic analysis and constant comparison process, we inductively coded and summarized data into themes. Five factors contributed to successful program implementation: value of peer support/feedback; building knowledge, champion confidence, and program ownership; informative curriculum, adaptable to targeted populations; staying abreast of current tobacco/nicotine research and products; and TTTF team responsiveness and practical coaching/assistance. Champions reported the TTTF train-the-trainer program was successful and identified attitudes and CoP processes that effectively built organizational capacity and expertise to sustainably address tobacco dependence. Study findings can guide other agencies in implementing sustainable tobacco-free training programs.",
