    "Abstract": "Background: Recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) during the perinatal period has unique challenges. We examined services for perinatal women with OUD using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) eight dimensions of wellness (DoW), which reflect whole person recovery. Methods: We enrolled professionals from the Southwestern United States who work with people with OUD during the perinatal period. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted from April to December 2020. Participants were shown the DoW diagram (emotional, social, environmental, physical, financial, spiritual, occupational, intellectual) and asked to share how their clinic/agency addresses each DoW for perinatal people with OUD. Responses were transcribed and coded by two researchers using Dedoose software. Results: Thematic analysis revealed ways professionals (n = 11) see how the services they provide fit into the DoW. This included: the need to provide mothers emotional support with a nonjudgmental approach, groups providing social support; guidance on nutrition, self-care, and a focus on the mother/infant dyad; assistance with employment and activities of daily living; parenting education; connecting mothers with resources and grants; providing a variety of spiritual approaches depending on the desire of the mother; and navigating the interpersonal environment as well as the physical space. Conclusions: There are opportunities to expand the treatment and services provided to women with OUD during the perinatal period within all eight DoWs. Additional research is needed to identify effective strategies to incorporate these components into patient-centered, holistic care approaches.",
