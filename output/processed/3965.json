    "Abstract": "Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the capacity of health and social care systems. The limited availability of care systems and the specific challenges of the pandemic have increased the burden and stress on family caregivers.Objective: This paper focuses on the burden of family caregivers in the light of their experiences with health and social services.Methods: Online questionnaire survey (n = 1004; active caregivers during COVID-19 pandemic: n = 491); data were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative (content analysis) methods.Results: More than half of the active caregivers experienced an increasing burden in caregiving after the release of COVID-19. Associations are between the increase in caregiving burden during COV1D-19 and the municipality type of caregiver's home, the cared for's dementia involvement, the use of home help or other care assistance, and employment. In addition, those who reported an increased burden due to the pandemic also perceived the caregiving role as more stressful. The most significant additional burden was the increased mental and psychological strain caused by restrictions, difficulties in providing care, and the pandemic.Discussion: Our results suggest that the increase in caregiving burden during COVID-19 can be explained by the specific challenges of the pandemic.Conclusion: Family caregivers are particularly vulnerable and need special emergency services in such situations. The significantly increased mental strain in emergency situations draws attention to the need for mental health care for carers.",
