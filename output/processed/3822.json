    "Abstract": "Clinical Impact Statement The relatively high rates of WTC-related PTSD found in Latino/a WTC responders are likely due to the social and economic stressors Latino/a subgroups more commonly face. Vulnerability factors, such as low socioeconomic status, having a psychiatric disorder, low social support from family and workplace and additional life stressors following the event contributed to higher rates of WTC-related PTSD regardless of racial/ethnic group. These results underscore the importance of implementing interventions that address the unique contextual conditions facing vulnerable subgroups, such as improved education and income, and mitigation of ongoing stressors.Objective: This study evaluated race/ethnic differences in the prevalence and correlates of World Trade Center (WTC) related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in WTC responders. Method: Data were analyzed from a population-based, health monitoring cohort of 15,440 nontraditional (i.e., construction workers) and 13,403 police WTC responders. Results: Among nontraditional responders, the prevalence of WTC-related PTSD was highest in Latino/a (40.4%) versus Black (27.3%) and White (26.5%) responders; among police responders, Latino/a (10.4%) responders also had higher prevalence of PTSD relative to Black (9.8%) and White (8.7%) responders. However, multivariable analyses revealed that prior psychiatric diagnosis, greater severity of WTC-related exposures, post-9/11 stressful life events, (in police responders only) older age, and (in nontraditional responders only) lower income and education levels accounted for substantially higher prevalence of WTC-related PTSD across ethnic/racial groups. Additionally, among nontraditional responders, subgroups with added risk included responders who were: Latino/a or White had high post-911 stressful events; Latino/a or Black and had pre-9/11 psychiatric history; and Latinas. Among police responders, subgroups with added risk were Latino/a or Black police with a low annual income. Conclusions: Collectively, results of this study underscore the burden of differential vulnerability that can contribute to higher prevalence of PTSD in certain cultural subgroups following large magnitude traumatic events.",
