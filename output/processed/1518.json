    "Abstract": "Abstract: Psychotic symptoms are frequent in the elderly. When using antipsychotics for the management of psychotic syndromes in this population, a distinction must be made between the aging of people with pre-existing mental disorders and those people with newly-onset psychotic symptoms. The latter increase with age, while the symptoms of early-onset diseases usually attenuate with age. Although antipsychotics are used in people of advanced age, there is no evidence of their efficacy. On the contrary, they can cause multiple problems, such as greater sensitivity to adverse effects and risk of drug interactions. Given the efficacy and safety data, the use of non-pharmacological interventions of a psychosocial type in the treatment of psychotic and behavioural problems in the elderly is mandatory. If they are not effective, the use of antipsychotic drugs can be justified, limited in dose and duration, and controlling the benefit/adverse effects ratio. Careful monitoring of adverse effects, including the subjective ones, should be an integral part of the therapeutic plan. The periodic re-evaluation of the need for their employment must always be made, and the withdrawal must be slow.",
