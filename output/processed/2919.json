    "Article Title": "The Transition to Adulthood for Young People with Autism Spectrum Disorder",
    "Abstract": "The transition to adulthood for individuals with autism spectrum disorder is difficult and outcomes are suboptimal. Social cognition deficits and executive dysfunction continue to be barriers to young people's success, lack of societal acceptance and loss of previous support can exacerbate the condition, and mental health issues increase. All areas of adult functioning are affected. To help manage the transition and improve outcomes for this population, psychiatrists and other health care providers need to be aware of the issues and possible interventions, including social skills training, educational transition programs, and supported employment programs.",
