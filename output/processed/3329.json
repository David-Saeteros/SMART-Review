    "Abstract": "Understanding Black therapists' educational decisions contributes to increasing Black therapists' representation and accessibility. The present study explored the role of racial identity attitudes, demographic factors, and motivations for becoming a therapist (e.g., personal experiences, altruism) in predicting membership in the subfields of counseling, clinical psychology, and social work. Black therapists (N = 129) were surveyed about their career trajectories and personal characteristics. Predictors of subfield membership were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Black therapists who endorsed the racial identity status of internalization and those who were motivated by family problems were more likely to be social workers or counselors than clinical psychologists. Attending a historically Black college/university and being motivated by professional altruism predicted membership in social work relative to clinical psychology, whereas those who were motivated by the experience of personal problems were more likely to be clinical psychologists than counselors or social workers. We conclude that Black therapists' career decision making appears to be consistent with the expressed values of psychotherapy subfields. Understanding Black therapists' motivations and career trajectories can inform recruitment and retention efforts within psychotherapist training and employment.",
