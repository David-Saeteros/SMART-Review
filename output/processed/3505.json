    "Article Title": "Impact of Key Workplace Breastfeeding Support Characteristics on Job Satisfaction, Breastfeeding Duration, and Exclusive Breastfeeding Among Health Care Employees",
    "Abstract": "Background: Although national breastfeeding rates have improved across recent decades, women continue to face barriers to achieving recommended breastfeeding targets. Returning to work presents a unique set of challenges for breastfeeding continuation, even in health care settings tasked with promoting breastfeeding among patients. This study examined the association between key workplace breastfeeding support characteristics, job satisfaction, and breastfeeding outcomes among health care employees. Materials and Methods: We used data from a cross-sectional survey of employees in a large integrated health care system. The study sample included female employees who had breastfed in the past 3 years (n = 165). The Employee Perceptions of Breastfeeding Support Questionnaire (EPBS-Q) measured organization, manager, and coworker support for breastfeeding. Regression analyses tested the association between workplace support factors and breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity, and job satisfaction. Results: Managerial support increased median job satisfaction by 0.39 standard deviations (p < 0.001), and increased the odds of prolonging exclusive breastfeeding (odds ratio [OR] 1.47; confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.09). Organizational support increased median job satisfaction by 0.27 standard deviations (p < 0.001), and increased the odds of exclusive breastfeeding by nearly twofold (OR 1.80; CI 1.05-3.09). No significant associations were found between workplace support factors (organizational, managerial, and co-worker support) and overall breastfeeding duration. Conclusions: Organizational and managerial support are key aspects of workplace lactation support, which may positively impact job satisfaction, rates of exclusive breastfeeding, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding among female health care employees. This intersection of outcomes salient for the business community and public health practitioners highlights opportunities for collaborations to improve workplace and breastfeeding outcomes.",
