    "Abstract": "Research indicates that people with multiple sclerosis (MS) are more likely to report poorer health and well-being than their peers without MS. Fortunately, it is also known that an individual's social and lifestyle factors play a great role on maintaining and promoting one's health and overall well-being. The present study aimed to examine the role that social integration and social support, in particular have on health and psychological well-being (PWB) among individuals with MS. One hundred and eighty three individuals with MS completed measures of social and lifestyle factors, personality, physical and mental health, MS disease symptomatology and PWB. Cross sectional, regression analyses were conducted to determine the role of social and other lifestyle factors (e.g., diet/exercise) on health and PWB. A subset of this sample (108) completed a follow-up assessment. Longitudinal analyses of this sample were also conducted. Consistent with previous findings, the presence of social integration and social support were significant predictors of health and PWB even when taking into account other lifestyle factors (i.e., diet/exercise, substance use, smoking), cardiovascular risk, demographics (i.e., gender, age, education, relationship status) and personality. The role of social integration and support on health and PWB is well established. Present findings confirmed these associations among individuals with MS. These findings suggest that social integration and social support should be a crucial part of MS management and that further interventional studies aimed at improving social integration and reducing social isolation are warranted in an effort to promote and maintain overall health and well-being.",
