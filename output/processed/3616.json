    "Abstract": "Background: People with comorbid alcohol/drug dependency and gambling disorder get worse results from treatment compared with patients with only one disorder. The treatment of individuals with comorbidities entails many difficulties because they receive the same treatment like everyone else despite studies showing that it is a heterogeneous group. This article identifies and discusses the unsatisfied treatment needs of people with comorbid alcohol/drug use and gambling disorder. Methods: A qualitative perspective (individual interviews) was applied. Our sample comprised 65 respondents and included people with comorbidity of substance use (alcohol/drugs) and gambling disorders, and professionals who were employed in the treatment sector . Results: Particular categories of need were identified, relating to dependence therapy, family relationships, and financial, legal and housing issues. The study did not engage with needs connected to counseling for employment problems, such as difficulties with finding or keeping a job or getting along with coworkers, but did identify other needs related to financial issues. Conclusions: The unsatisfied treatment needs identified should be considered in designing therapeutic provision for people with comorbid alcohol/drug use and gambling disorder. This may trigger a greater acceptance of such provision and encourage individuals to seek treatment at earlier stage of dependence, as well as increase rates of retention in treatment.",
