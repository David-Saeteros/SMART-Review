    "Article Title": "Facilitators and barriers to employment for people with physical disabilities: A cross-sectional study",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that employment, or the lack thereof, affects an individual's health. Consequently, employment provides people with physical disabilities (PWPD) with financial independence, enhances their well-being and self-worth, and facilitates a sense of purpose. People with physical disabilities often retain job skills and motivation to return to work after acquiring a disability. Their vocational rehabilitation and job accommodation needs likely differ from people with disabilities resulting from developmental, sensory, cognitive, and mental health conditions. To better target the needs of PWPD and improve vocational rehabilitation services, it is crucial to identify the modifiable factors that influence their employment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to examine systematically the client-, employer-, and context-related facilitators and barriers to employment experienced by PWPD. METHODS: We recruited to this cross-sectional study, PWPD from the Midwestern United States who returned to work after injury or illness. An online survey collected data on demographic characteristics and educational history; disability and functional status; supports, facilitators and barriers to employment; and job information and accommodations. RESULTS: 347 working-age PWPD completed the survey; at the time of survey completion, 270 were working and 77 were not. People with physical disabilities who reported social support and encouragement at work were more likely to be working than respondents who did not. Negative attitudes of supervisors and colleagues, inaccessible work environments, and inflexible work schedules were barriers to employment. Important reasons for working included financial needs, a sense of purpose, and self-worth. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide insights into the importance of social supports in the work environment. Novel approaches are needed to develop supportive relationships with supervisors and coworkers.",
