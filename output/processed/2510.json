    "Abstract": "This study aims to explore the perceptions of the Venezuelan immigrant population in Medellin, Colombia, regarding their employment, working and health conditions (physical, mental and psychosocial). A qualitative study was conducted (focused ethnography perspective). Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 31 Venezuelans and 12 key informants from different social organisations that work with the immigrant population. A narrative content analysis was carried out (Atlas.Ti 8.0 software). The migratory process for Venezuelans is caused for political, economical and social aspects in Venezuela and Colombia is offered as the first destination for labour establishing. Access to the labour market is limited to certain occupations, in many cases in the informal economy. Participants referring low salaries, working long hours and reduced social benefits. Occupational risks are evidenced by low experience in the labour market. Some health problems are perceived, and a good part of the interviewed population referred to signs and symptoms related to mental health problems. Barriers to access health and social protection services were found. Finally, future expectations depend on their adaptation to Colombia, the improvement of social conditions in Venezuela or having chances of improving their social and living conditions in another country. A high labour and social vulnerability were found in Venezuelan participants that impact on physical and mental health. Political and strategies from a public health perspective are required and the implementation of systems for monitoring and evaluating the labour and health situation in the working immigrant population.",
