    "Article Title": "Employability narratives in digital storytelling: do overqualified Brazilian and Venezuelan immigrants in Portugal tell the same story?",
    "Abstract": "Migration has been steadily increasing worldwide, bringing with it precarious work conditions and the issue of overqualification, having repercussions on job satisfaction and the mental health of migrants. This study explores digital storytelling (DST) as a tool to promote debate on those issues among immigrant workers and potentiate soft skills valued in the job market. A three-day DST workshop and focus group with 7 semi and skilled Brazilian and Venezuelan immigrants working in Portugal showed barriers familiar to all employability trajectories and the importance of social capital and social support, especially the latter group, leaning towards collectivist values, and facing additional language barriers in the adaptation process. The advantages and disadvantages of DST and immigrants' perceptions of Portuguese employers are also listed. Results point to DST being a relevant tool in the context of employability in migration, promoting debate, sharing information about decent work, and developing valued soft skills in immigrants.",
