    "Abstract": "Studies on relationships between psychosocial factors and health among North African (NA) women are scarce. This research investigated the self-perceived psychosocial well-being of NA women by a structured questionnaire and anthropometric survey examining the possible explanatory variables of their mental health in comparison to a sample of NA migrants. The association of endogenous stress, psychological well-being, discomfort, and quality of life with migrant/non-migrant status, demographic characteristics, and adiposity indices was examined. Moreover, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was tested using Cronbach's alpha. A sample of 228 women living in Tunis and Casablanca participated in a survey in Tunisia and Morocco. According to multiple regression models, migrant/non-migrant status was the best explanatory variable of well-being and quality of life, marital status, educational level and the number of children were explanatory variables of discomfort and endogenous stress. Among anthropometric variables, central adiposity was a significant explanatory variable of well-being. The comparison with women who migrated mainly from Morocco and Tunisia to Italy (NA migrants) exhibited higher weight status and central adiposity in NA migrants. The perceived stress and discomfort were the same in the two groups; the migrants, despite reporting lower psychological well-being, presented a higher quality of life than residents. Our findings emphasise the potential to promote monitoring of the psychosocial health of NA women, planning effective interventions.",
