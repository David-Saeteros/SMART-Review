    "Abstract": "Across the globe, the research into the influence of paternal risk and protective factors on the family, as well as on the involvement of fathers in family-related interventions, is lacking. This study utilized 506 families and examined the characteristics of fathers in psychosocially stressed families and associations between paternal risk factors (PRFs: mental health disorder, physical health disorder, young paternity, unemployment, absence of father) and family risk factors (FRFs: problematic financial situation, problematic housing situation, social isolation) for child maltreatment. The identification of PRFs and FRFs was carried out using information from consultations with social education workers and from a risk inventory completed by the mothers. The data analysis revealed an increased incidence of economic problems found in families with fathers having mental health issues, fathers under the age of 22, and unemployed fathers or single mothers. Other factors such as social isolation occurred more often in families with a single mother. The present study underlines the importance of a father's involvement for young families. Future research and program recommendations should always systematically include the father's role in family-related interventions.",
