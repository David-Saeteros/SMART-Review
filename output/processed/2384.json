    "Abstract": "Purpose: Roughly 3 million adult Americans have a visual impairment or blindness, and over 4 million adults aged 40 and older. Despite data demonstrating an elevated prevalence of mental health symptoms in people with BVI, this population remains largely untreated. Given that people with BVI often interface with multiple systems of rehabilitative care that are designed to improve quality of life, the relatively low rates of initiation of mental health care services are particularly alarming. In this review, the systematic processes of mental health care services across pertinent rehabilitation groups are identified and critically examined. Patients and Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted. The literature review utilized a critical systems typology, whereby relevant literature was selected, reviewed, and analyzed intra and extra organizationally. In addition, a thorough discussion of disability-related factors was provided, lending a socio-political lens to the problem. Results: Considerable data indicates that short -term mental health care services for people with BVI are ineffective treatment methods, albeit primarily employed in health-rehabilitative processes. Multiple studies offered data indicating the presence of diverse and entangled mental health issues relative to vocational rehabilitation services, mobility tool utility, and emotional reactions to vision loss. Many studies suggested that disability identity work be integrated into health-rehabilitative processes for people with BVI. Conclusion: To improve the utility of mental health care services for people with BVI, a reenergization of the mental health care needs of this population must occur. A critical podcast or forum focused on educating listeners about the health-rehabilitation factors that influence the provision of mental health care services can aid to improve future mental health policy and practice for people with BVI. Disability scholars need to advance research on integrating critical theories in work with people with BVI and accelerate qualitative, community-based methods to enhance understanding of this population and their unique mental health needs.
