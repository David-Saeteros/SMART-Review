    "Abstract": "Background: First Contact Physiotherapists (FCPs) were introduced to reduce demands on GPs by providing improving access to expert musculoskeletal care. FCPs experience similar workplace stressors to GPs and there is an emerging concern that remote consultations are causing further impacts to their wellbeing.Aim: To explore the impact of remote consultations on FCPs.Methods: A mixed methods sequential explanatory study with FCPs was conducted. An online survey measured the usage and impact of remote consultations. Semi-structured interviews explored the lived experiences of using remote consultations.Results: The online survey was completed by 109 FCPs. A key benefit of remote consultations was patient convenience; perceived challenges included IT issues, poor efficacy, FCP anxiety, isolation, and increased workload. FCPs viewed remote consultations as a 'challenge' rather than a 'threat'. Nearly two thirds of the FCPs had not received relevant training, yet over half were interested. Follow-up interviews with 16 FCPs revealed 4 themes: (1) Remote consultations provide logistical benefits to the patient; (2) Compromised efficacy is the key challenge of remote consultations; (3) Challenges for FCPs working in areas of high deprivation; and (4) Remote consultations impact the health, wellbeing and work satisfaction of FCPs.Conclusions: Remote consultations offer a convenient alternative for patients, but may add to FCP stress particularly in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. Further research is required to understand how remote consultations can be enhanced when communication barriers and lower levels of digital literacy exist. Continued monitoring of job satisfaction and resilience levels is important to ensure FCPs remain in their role.",
