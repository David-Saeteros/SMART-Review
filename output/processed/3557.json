    "Article Title": "Always Connected: Technology Use Increases Technostress Among Public Managers",
    "Abstract": "Despite the growing use and adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in government, few studies investigate how ICTs impact the well-being of public managers in the workplace. Information system and psychology studies define technostress as a form of stress stemming from the social and technical changes brought by ICTs use. Public managers likely experience technostress as ICTs become pervasive in their professional and private life and add new demands to their workload. Using nationwide 2014 survey data of 2,500 local government managers, we focus on technology use and individual and organizational practices around ICT use to investigate their effect on technostress. We find that ICT use for professional purposes increases technostress, but public organizations can reduce technostress by providing policies and guidelines on ICT use. Personal use of ICTs and electronic monitoring do not affect technostress. We discuss implications for technology and human resource management in public organizations.",
