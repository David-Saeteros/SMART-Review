    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of social support as a buffer between traumatic life events and HRQOL. We hypothesized that social support would mediate the effect of traumatic life events on HRQOL. A total of 2987 PLHIV participated in this study. The sample included 1876 (62.8%) males, and 1111 (37.2%) females. Data were collected using survey instruments measuring exposure to traumatic life events, functions of social support and HRQOL. The Structural Equation Model (SEM) produced a chi-square (chi(2) = 486.63, df = 32, p < .001) along with other goodness of fit indices such as CFI/TLI = .958/.941 and RMSEA = .069 (90%CI: .064, .074). Structural coefficients for traumatic life events, functions of social support, and HRQOL were statistically significant (<=.05). Crisis was the strongest predictor of traumatic life events, emotional support was the strongest predictor of functions of social support, and health distress was the strongest indicator of HRQOL. Traumatic life events had a significant direct effect on HRQOL. For PLHIV, experiencing a financial crisis associated with loss and/ or difficulty finding employment and enacted stigma were experienced as traumatic life events. Emotional support, described as having supportive interpersonal relationships, was identified as essential for HRQOL. Implications for interventions were discussed.",
