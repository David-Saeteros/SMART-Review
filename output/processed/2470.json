    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the influence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, and PTSD and depression severity, on the postconcussive symptom trajectory over the course of a 1-year study period. Research Design: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing veterans who received supported employment combined with compensatory cognitive training to those who received supported employment only. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 3-(postintervention), 6-, and 12-months. Participants were 50 Operation Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans with a history of mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) who were unemployed, seeking work, and who had neuropsychological impairment. Of all participants, 74% met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. All participants received supported employment and half of the sample also received Cognitive Symptom Management and Rehabilitation Therapy (CogSMART), a 12-session, manualized compensatory cognitive training intervention. Results: Veterans with PTSD and greater depression severity endorsed significantly more severe postconcussive symptomatology at all assessment time points. However, the rate of CogSMART-associated improvement in postconcussive symptoms did not differ as a result of psychiatric symptomatology. Conclusion: Study results suggest that for veterans with a history of mild to moderate TBI, presence of comorbid PTSD or depressive symptoms should not preclude participation in cognitive rehabilitation interventions.",
