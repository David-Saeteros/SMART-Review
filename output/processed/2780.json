    "Article Title": "Negative Cognitions and Emotional Distress Following Job Loss: Development and Validation of the Beliefs About Loss of Work (BLOW) Scale",
    "Abstract": "Negative cognitions following job loss can contribute to emotional distress by motivating individuals to adopt coping styles that reduce stress in the short run while obstructing adjustment in the long run. It is unclear which specific cognitions are related to symptoms of complicated grief, depression, and anxiety following job loss. To fill this gap, this study introduces the Beliefs about Loss of Work (BLOW) scale and examines its psychometric properties. We recruited 222 Dutch workers who had lost their job, including 70 men and 152 women, with an average age of 52.5 years. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a second-order eight-factor model had the best fit to the data. The BLOW scale is a reliable instrument with a good convergent and divergent validity. This instrument may stimulate research on mechanisms involved in job loss-related distress and could inform the development of interventions to reduce this distress.",
