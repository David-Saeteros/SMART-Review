    "Abstract": "Introduction. - This study objective was to describe, considering the French legal framework and current practices, the completed actions and the occupational health services resources mobilized during the reinstatement visit, and identify the unfit to work decision associated factors, in particular in case of musculoskeletal and mental health diseases.Method. - The data were collected during the Remain at work cross sectional study from March to April 2019 in the Hauts-de-France regional occupational health services. The questionnaires were filled by the occupational health doctors for every worker seen in a reinstatement visit after a sick leave absence longer than]0 days.Results. - In total, 5032 questionnaires completed by 208 doctors were analysed. The reinstatement visit after a sick leave absence longer than 30 days concluded to an unfit to work decision for 12.3% of all the workers, but it was 21.7% when the sick leave cause was a mental health problem (16.1% of total sick leave) and 10.5% when it was a musculoskeletal disease (56.3% of total sick leave). Factors significantly associated with inability at work in case of a mental health disease were: being an employment obligation recipient, the disease professional origin, a long term sick leave, working in a 50 or less employees company and being exposed to psychological pressure. In case of musculoskeletal disease, these factors were being 50 years old or more, the clerk/service worker status, a long term sick leave, being an employment obligation recipient, working in the construction industry and time constraints.Conclusion. - The implementation and evaluation of a return to work plan are needed to improve job retention.",
