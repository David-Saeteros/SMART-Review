    "Abstract": "Background Service providers working with people experiencing homelessness can be directly and indirectly exposed to trauma and other chronic stressors in their work. The types of individuals that are most at-risk of problematic outcomes from traumatic event exposure are unknown. Aim This study examined exposure to and effects of workplace traumas and stressors among service providers working with people experiencing homelessness in Canada. Methods A cross-sectional survey was completed by 701 direct service providers working in the homeless service, supportive housing, and harm reduction sectors. Descriptive statistics, hierarchical multiple regression, and double moderation models were used in the analysis. Results Employment in homeless service settings, service provision to single adults, and more time in direct contact with service users were each positively associated with the frequency of exposure to critical events and chronic stressors. Younger age, lived experience of behavioural health problems, more frequent exposure to chronic stressors, and less social support from coworkers were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress and general psychological distress. Emotional support from supervision moderated the relationship between direct exposure to workplace critical events and post-traumatic stress. Conclusions More trauma-informed psychosocial supports tailored to the needs of direct service providers working with people experiencing homelessness are needed.",
