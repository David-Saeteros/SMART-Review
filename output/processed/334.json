    "Article Title": "Prediction of prolonged treatment course for depressive and anxiety disorders in an outpatient setting: The Leiden routine outcome monitoring study",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to improve clinical identification of patients with a prolonged treatment course for depressive and anxiety disorders early in treatment.Method: We conducted a cohort study in 1.225 adult patients with a depressive or anxiety disorders in psychiatric specialty care setting between 2007 and 2011, with at least two Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) assessments within 6 months. With logistic regression, we modelled baseline age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, housing situation, employment status, psychiatric comorbidity and both baseline and 1st follow-up BSI scores to predict prolonged treatment course (> 2 years). Based on the regression coefficients, we present an easy to use risk prediction score.Results: BSI at 1st follow-up proved to be a strong predictor for both depressive and anxiety disorders (OR=2.17 (CI95% 1.73-2.74); OR=2.52 (CI95% 1.86-3.23)). The final risk prediction score included BSI 1st follow-up and comorbid axis II disorder for depressive disorder, for anxiety disorders BSI 1st follow-up and age were included. For depressive disorders, for 28% of the patients with the highest scores, the positive predictive value for a prolonged treatment course was60% (sensitivity 0.38, specificity 0.81). For anxiety disorders, for 35% of the patients with the highest scores, the positive predictive value for a prolonged treatment course was 52% (sensitivity 0.55, specificity 0.75).Conclusions: A high level of symptoms at 2-6 months of follow-up is a strong predictor for prolonged treatment course. This facilitates early identification of patients at risk of a prolonged course of treatment; in a relatively easy way by a self-assessed symptom severity.",
