    "Abstract": "Background Loneliness among military veterans may have unique features because of deployment-related experiences. Consequently, loneliness is increasingly recognized as an issue that may affect the health of veterans, even years after military deployment.Aims To examine the prevalence of loneliness in Dutch veterans and to assess the extent to which their loneliness is associated with deployment-related factors.Methods We invited 6000 veterans who have left the Armed Forces to fill out a questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to assess the association between loneliness and deployment-related factors in addition to demographic information, social support and needs of care.Results We received the responses of 2643 veterans (44%). Of them, 27% experienced at least some loneliness and 13% experienced severe loneliness. Social support, perceived comradeship during deployment and a perceived positive effect of one's deployment on life at present are negatively related to loneliness. Younger age, living alone (with or without children), unemployment or work disability, needs of care in general or deployment-related, perceived frustration related to the deployment and longing back to the time of the deployment were positively associated with loneliness.Conclusions Feelings of loneliness are prevalent among Dutch veterans who have left the Armed Forces. Veterans' loneliness is associated with several deployment-related factors. To reduce veterans' loneliness, attention for deployment-related experiences and its consequences is recommended.",
