    "Abstract": "The present study analyses the moderating effect of different types of social support in the relationship between bullying, cyberbullying and workplace victimization, and internalizing symptoms in LGBTIQ+ individuals. 262 people from LGBTIQ+ collective participated (ages between 18 and 77; M= 29.83, SD= 12.41), who completed measures via Internet of bullying, cyberbullying, workplace victimization, family support, support from friends, support from a special person, and symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress. The results showed that support from friends moderated the relationship between bullying and anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as the relationship between workplace victimization and depression symptoms. On the other hand, family support moderated the relationship between bullying and anxiety symptoms. Regarding cyberbullying, none of the types of social support moderated the relationship between cyberbullying and internalizing symptomatology. Findings of this study highlight the moderating role of family and friend support when internalizing symptoms of LGBTIQ+ people who are victims of bullying and/or workplace victimization.",
