    "Abstract": "Background and ObjectivesAn increased percentage of individuals entering opioid addiction treatment programs also report the presence of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). This study examined associations between the presence of CNCP and 6-month medication assisted addiction treatment (MAT) outcomes.MethodsThe sample included 585 individuals at opiate treatment programs who completed a structured intake interview and a 6-month follow-up telephone interview between March 2007 and December 2010. Of the sample, 115 individuals reported CNCP at intake and 6-month follow-up. Bivariate analyses compared individuals with CNCP (n=115) and without CNCP (n=470) at MAT intake.ResultsA greater percentage of individuals with CNCP were older, were retired or disabled, and had experienced depression or anxiety before intake compared to individuals without CNCP. Results of binomial logistic regression models found that having CNCP was associated with increased odds of depression/anxiety at follow-up, but had no association with employment or substance use.Conclusions and Scientific SignificanceThe correlations between CNCP and co-occurring depression/anxiety among MAT clients indicate an area of special concern for providers. A full biopsychosocial, including a focus on history of chronic physical pain, might be beneficial to help highlight potential co-morbidities and to encourage closer monitoring of the intertwining relationships between addiction, CNCP, and depression/anxiety.
