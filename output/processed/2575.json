    "Article Title": "Exploring the Role of Depressive Symptoms, Service Members, and Spousal Demographic Characteristics on Military Spousal Employment",
    "Abstract": "Military spouses, most of whom are women, often contend with a number of factors that can influence their employment status. Previous studies have examined the role of service-member and spousal demographic characteristics on wives' employment. However, little is known about the role spousal mental health has on employment while controlling for demographic characteristics. Using repeated-measures logistic regressions, this longitudinal study explored associations between spousal mental health and employment while controlling for service-member and spousal characteristics in a sample of 1,164 women. Fewer depressive symptoms were significantly associated with employment (p < .05). Spouses of enlisted personnel, women who were older, racial/ethnic minorities, homeowners, or had city stability, had higher odds of employment (p < .05). Military spouses of active duty service members and those less educated had lower odds of employment (p < .05). Depressive symptoms and demographic characteristics should guide employment opportunity programs for military spouses.",
