    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted social distancing measures and forced transition to virtual learning for university students. Examining the impact of these disruptions on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological distress can contribute to the design of interventions and psychological services aimed at mitigating the long-term effects for vulnerable populations. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 225 predominantly Hispanic urban university students in Southern California. An online survey gathered sociodemographic variables and psychosocial factors (HRQoL [RAND-36], psychological well-being Psychological General Well Being Index [PGWBI-22], and perceived stress). Employment and sleep, as well as current use, and future interest in various mind-body and psychological services were also examined. Compared with national averages, participants scored statistically significantly higher on HRQoL subscales of Physical Functioning, Physical Role Functioning, Pain, and General Health. Participants scored statistically significantly lower on subscales of Emotional Role Functioning, Energy/Fatigue, Emotional Well-Being, Social Functioning, and Health Status. The majority of participants indicated a loss of employment (49.3%), increases in perceived stress, and sleep disturbances during COVID-19. Overall, students reported severe psychological distress based on the Psychological General Well-Being Index, and a fraction (12.8%) indicated they were currently using psychological counseling services. The majority of participants were interested or very interested in mind-body interventions (i.e., yoga, meditation). Recent data show that the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing policies negatively affect specifically students of color. We discuss how stress and social distancing may impact immune functioning, health, and social support. In the long term, COVID-19 underscores the need for culturally competent mental health care targeting Hispanic populations who may be uniquely and disproportionately affected.",
