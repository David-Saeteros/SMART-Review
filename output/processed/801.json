    "Abstract": "Background: Supported employment is an effective intervention for people with serious mental illnesses (SMI) but is underutilized. Clients' desire to work might be heightened by programs that provide counseling about managing one's funds, since money management helps people become more aware of the advantages of having money.Aim: To analyze the thoughts of recently homeless or hospitalized persons with SMI concerning their personal finances and employment.Methods: We interviewed 49 people with SMI about their finances, reviewed transcripts and analyzed their baseline characteristics.Results: Twenty of the 49 participants spontaneously expressed a desire to work in order to earn more money. Those who expressed a desire to work managed their money significantly better than those who did not.Conclusion: Discussion of finances, such as that fostered by money management programs, may promote engagement in vocational rehabilitation and working for pay.",
