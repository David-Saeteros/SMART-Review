    "Abstract": "In recent years, it is widely accepted that the experiences of individuals who benefit from mental health services are reflected in the treatment and rehabilitation process in the field of mental health. Transferring the experiences of individuals to the treatment process has put the concept of peer support at the forefront. Peer support means that individuals with personal experience in mental health use this experiential expertise to help other individuals with mental health problems during the recovery process. Peer support is a system that allows individuals with mental health problems to partner, feel understood by each other, and build emotional intimacy. It is known that peer support contributes in a positive direction to both those who provide peer support and those who benefit from this support Peer support is handled in a wide framework ranging from individual friendship relations to employment of support service providers in institutions. In many countries, peer support practices are used as a component of mental health services. It is recommended to use peer support during treatment throughout the world. This article discusses the birth, definition, types and contributions that the concept of peer support can make to the healing process.",
