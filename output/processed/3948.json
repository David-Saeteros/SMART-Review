    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Explore relief and mobile veterinarians' views and experiences related to their current job. In addition, examine rea- sons why these veterinarians opted to pursue careers in relief and mobile practice. SAMPLE Veterinary members of the Veterinary Information Network working as relief or mobile veterinarians. METHODS An electronic survey distributed via the Veterinary Information Network data collection portal from May 11, 2023, through May 30, 2023. RESULTS A total of 444 responses were collected (125 veterinarians in mobile practice and 240 relief veterinarians). Factors most commonly reported to have a strong effect on mobile or relief veterinarians' decision to leave their previous job included administration, hospital culture, leadership, feeling their voice was heard, and workplace schedule factors. The majority of mobile and relief practitioners reported feeling satisfied with their work -life balance (mobile, 78%; relief, 91%) as well as availability for children (mobile, 84%; relief, 84%) and other family members (mobile, 85%; relief, 87%). CLINICAL RELEVANCE The majority of mobile and relief practitioners who participated in this survey reported feeling satisfied or very satisfied with managing their work and life, in their ability to be present and available for their children, and having opportunity to support and care for elderly family members and those with medical needs. As the field of veterinary medicine becomes increasingly feminized, schedule flexibility and work -life balance will likely increase in impor- tance, making careers in nonpractice settings more desirable. Traditional brick -and -mortar clinics should note that dissatisfaction with administration and office/hospital culture might drive their employees to pursue other career avenues such as relief or mobile practice.",
