    "Article Title": "Insights Into the Experience of Liver Transplant Recipients With Alcoholic Liver Disease: A Descriptive Qualitative Study.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) due to alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the primary cause of liver transplantation (LT) in the United States. Studies have found that LT recipients experience a range of physical and emotional difficulties posttransplantation including return to alcohol use, depression, and anxiety. The aim of this study is to better understand the experiences of LT recipients with ALD because they recovered posttransplant to inform the development of a patient-centered intervention to assist patients during recovery.METHODS: Using qualitative methods, researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 ALD LT recipients. The primary topics of the interview were physical recovery, mental health, substance use including alcohol and tobacco use, and financial experiences. Common patient themes were identified and coded.RESULTS: Within the domain of physical health, patients stressed that undergoing LT was a near-death experience, they were helpless, changes in weight influenced their perception of their illness, and they have ongoing medical problems. In the domain of mental health, patients described cognitive impairments during their initial recovery, difficulty in processing the emotions of having a terminal condition, ongoing depression, anxiety, and irritability. The patients also described their perception of having AUD, the last time they used alcohol and their attitude to AUD treatment posttransplant. Patients also described their reliance on one member of their social support network for practical assistance during their recovery and identified one member of their medical team as being of particular importance in providing emotional as well as medical support during recovery.CONCLUSIONS: The patient's description of their lived experience during the months following transplant informed the development of a patient-centered intervention that colocates behavioral health components with medical treatment that helps broaden their social network while addressing topics that emerged from this study.",
