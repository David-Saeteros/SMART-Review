    "Abstract": "Transgender Latinas in the United States are an understudied and underserved community at high risk for negative health outcomes. This study used the Minority Stress Model as a framework to investigate the effects of transgender-specific distal minority stress processes and resilience factors on the mental health of transgender Latinas. We conducted a secondary analysis of Latina participants (weighted N = 1,363) from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS), the largest and most recent national survey of transgender individuals. Participants completed a series of self-report measures online including indices of mental health, experiences of employment, discrimination and violence, and family-related factors among others. We hypothesized that participants would report high rates of the negative mental health outcomes (i.e., serious psychological distress, binge drinking/illicit drug use, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts); endorsement of distal minority stressors (i.e., employment status, general discrimination/violence, housing discrimination, and discrimination/violence in places of public accommodation) would be associated with worse mental health outcomes; while endorsement of resilience factors (i.e., being out to family and family support) would be associated with positive mental health outcomes. As expected, weighted analyses indicated that participants who experienced discrimination/violence were more likely to report serious psychological distress, substance use, and suicidal behaviors. Generally, participants who were out to their family and had supportive families were less likely to report serious psychological distress and suicide attempts. Findings indicate that transgender-specific discrimination and violence negatively impact the mental health of transgender Latinas and familial resilience factors help mitigate these negative mental health effects.Public Significance Statement This study investigated how distal minority stress processes and resilience factors impacted mental health outcomes among transgender Latinas. Our findings indicated that transgender-specific discrimination/violence (i.e., distal minority stress processes) predicted serious psychological distress, substance use, and suicidal behaviors, while being out to family and family support (i.e., resilience factors) served as protective factors against serious psychological distress and suicide attempts.",
