    "Article Title": "Intimate Partner Violence Among South Asian Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Prevalence and Risk Factors",
    "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to understand the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among South Asian women during COVID-19, and to identify predictors of IPV presence and severity. We recruited South Asian women (n = 132) to complete an online survey about their mood, experiences with COVID-19, and IPV. 47% of South Asian women (n = 132) reported experiencing any IPV, most commonly economic abuse. Women experiencing IPV had higher rates of COVID-19 related worry (t=-1.3, p = .001) and anxiety (t=-2.2, p = .027). The following variables were associated with greater odds of experiencing IPV: COVID-19 related worry (OR: 1.44 [1.11, 1.87]) and full-time employment status (OR: 0.13 [0.02, 0.99]). Depressive symptoms were a significant positive predictor of economic abuse severity (b = 0.80, p = .002). Future research should examine cultural and environmental factors that interact with the experience of IPV among South Asian women to better inform interventions for survivors.",
