    "Article Title": "Family Support of Older Caregivers: Factors Influencing Change in Quality of Life",
    "Abstract": "Understanding factors that can improve the quality of life (QOL) of older caregivers of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) is important in broadening participation in family empowerment interventions. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors influencing the QOL of older caregivers (50+) of adults with IDD who participated in a peer-mediated state-wide family support project. The research study used a quasi-experimental research design grounded in the family quality of life (FQOL) framework, with pretest and posttest data gathered from 82 caregivers. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to identify factors influencing changes in the QOL of study participants. Findings indicated that improvements in caregiver QOL after participating in the project could be explained by caregiver 's employment status, increased global FQOL, and decreased caregiver stress and depression.",
