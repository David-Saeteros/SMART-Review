Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of UI in women aged 40 and older as well as its risk factors and also its effect on quality of life. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 286 women included in the sample. Subjects were selected randomly. The data were collected using a questionnaire, which was prepared by the researchers, and the Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using number, percentage, mean, Chi-square test, and binary logistic regression analysis in the SPSS program. Results: It was found that 86 (30.1%) of the women experienced the symptom of UI. The women had mostly the mixed UI. The correlations between UI and age, educational level, status of employment, the presence of chronic diseases, chronic constipation, difficult birth history, and state of menopause were significant.
