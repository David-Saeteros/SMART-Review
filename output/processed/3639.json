    "Abstract": "Objective: To analyse the relationship between the social support network (SSN) and health related quality of life (HRQOL) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: The sample comprised 150 consecutive MS patients attending our MS clinic. To assess the socio-demographic data, a specifically designed questionnaire was applied. The HRQOL dimensions were measured with the Short-Form Health Survey Questionnaire-SF36 and the SSN with the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. Spearman's correlation was used to compare the magnitude of the relationship between the SSN and HRQOL. Results: The mean patient age was 41.7 years (+/- 10.4; range: 18-70 yr); the mean Expanded Disability Status Score was 2.5 (+/- 2.4; range: 0-9). There was a statistically significant correlation between the structure of the SSN and the HRQOL. Conclusion: The composition of the SSN, social group membership and participation in voluntary work have an important role in the HRQOL of patients with MS.",
