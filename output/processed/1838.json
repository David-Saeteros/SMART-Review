    "Abstract": "Context: The work-life interface has been a much discussed and researched area within athletic training. The National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement on work-life balance highlighted the profession's interest in this topic. However, gaps in the literature remain and include the roles of time-based conflict and social support.Objective: To compare work-family conflict (WFC) and social support among athletic trainers (ATs) employed in the 2 most common practice settings.Design: Cross-sectional observational survey.Setting: Collegiate and secondary school settings.Patients or Other Participants: A total of 474 (females = 231, males = 243) ATs who were employed in the collegiate (205, 43.2%) or secondary school (269, 56.8%) setting.Main Outcome Measure(s): Data were collected through a Web-based survey designed to measure conflict and social support. Likert responses were summed. Demographic information was analyzed for frequency and distribution. Independent t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were calculated to determine group differences. Linear regression was used to determine if social support predicted WFC.Results: Social provisions and WFC were negatively correlated, and the social provisions score predicted WFC. No WFC differences (P= .778) were found between collegiate and high school ATs even though collegiate ATs worked more hours (63 +/- 11) during their busiest seasons compared with those in the high school setting (54 +/- 13, P < .001). Similarly, no difference (P = .969) was present between men and women, although men worked more hours. Our participants scored highest on time-based WFC items.Conclusions: Work-family conflict was experienced globally in 2 of the most common athletic training settings and between sexes. This indicates WFC is universally experienced and therefore needs to be addressed, specifically with a focus on time-based conflict. In addition to time-management strategies, ATs need support from coworkers, peers, and family members.",
