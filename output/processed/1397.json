    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate associations between adverse changes in employment status and physical and mental health among US adults (aged 18 years or older) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data from participants (N = 2565) of a national Internet panel (June 2020) were assessed using path analyses to test associations between changes in self-reported employment status and hours worked and physical and mental health outcomes. Results: Respondents who lost a job after March 1, 2020 (vs those who did not) reported more than twice the number of mentally unhealthy days. Females and those lacking social support had significantly worse physical and mental health outcomes. Participants in the lowest, pre-pandemic household income groups reported experiencing worse mental health. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the importance of providing economic and social support services to US adults experiencing poor mental and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
