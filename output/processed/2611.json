    "Article Title": "Predicting Burnout, Well-Being, and Posttraumatic Growth in Correctional Officers",
    "Abstract": "Correctional officers work in a stressful environment and are exposed to elevated levels of critical incidents. Such exposure can lead to negative psychological outcomes like burnout. However, positive psychological experiences including well-being and posttraumatic growth are also possible under such adverse conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore predictors of burnout, well-being, and posttraumatic growth in a sample of correctional officers (N = 142). The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that age, workplace adversity, and resilience were significant predictors of correctional officer burnout. A sense of workplace belongingness and the use of adaptive coping strategies were significant positive predictors of well-being and posttraumatic growth. Trait resilience and the receipt of social support were additional significant positive predictors of well-being. These results highlight the importance of individual, interpersonal, and organizational factors in promoting positive health outcomes, preventing negative health outcomes, and providing avenues for staff support.",
