    "Abstract": "Cognitive remediation (CR) aims to decrease cognitive deficits and provide palliative strategies for reintegration of patients with psychic disability. It is part of a personalized care program and requires multidisciplinary assessment and management, including eventually other psychosocial therapies. This study, carried out in 2016, aims to establish an inventory of accessibility and practice of the CR in Ile-de-France, to promote broad access and systematize the integration of CR in a global and coherent course. The CR is proposed by nearly 58 % of the structures that answered the survey, but its implementation could be improved: it stands for 58 % in a specific project and the multidisciplinary evaluation before/after is carried out at 51 % in Adult Psychiatry and 20 % in Child and Teen Psychiatry (CTP), perhaps due to a lack of qualified staff (neuropsychologists). The programs used in CTP are nonspecific. The accommodation capacity should be increased by group programs. Despite a lack of knowledge to fill, there is an important interest for the CR with a will expressed by 12 structures to be trained. Other psychosocial therapies, although better known, would benefit from being more often proposed and labeled by the Regional Health Agency. Our results confirm a scarcity of psychiatric care's supply in 77, 91 and 93. Four rehabilitation units in the 77 and 3 in the 91 are being trained. Three structures in the 77 and 2 in the 91 are willing to get trained. Supporting them is all the more important as the good practice of CR has a direct effect on social costs' benefits. Since then, in the entire region, 8 structures have proposed for a CR and rehabilitation platform. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",
