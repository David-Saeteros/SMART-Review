    "Article Title": "Adults With Head and Neck Burns Experience Worse Long-Term Outcomes and Require More Reconstructive Surgeries A Burn Model System Study",
    "Abstract": "Background: Adults living with head and neck burn injuries experience psychosocial consequences due to scarring as well as functional disabilities. However, the impact of head and neck burns on long-term self-reported psychosocial outcomes, return to work, and need for reconstructive surgery has not been well described. This study investigates the unique longitudinal problems in psychosocial and functional recovery faced by adults with head and neck burn injuries. Methods: Utilizing the multicenter Burn Model System (BMS) National Database, long-term psychosocial and functional outcomes as well as postdischarge reconstructive surgery rates between adult participants with and without head and neck burns injured after 2014 were compared. Results: Of 1247 participants, 579 had head and neck burns and 668 had non-head and neck burns. Head and neck burn was a significant predictor of worse anxiety (beta = 1.63, P = 0.049) and body image (beta = -0.30, P = 0.011) at 6 months post burn; worse anxiety (beta = 2.68, P = 0.004), depression (beta = 2.14, P = 0.021), and body image (beta = -0.41, P = 0.001) at 12 months post burn; and worse life satisfaction (beta = -1.64, P = 0.036) at 24 months post burn. Head and neck burn participants reported significantly worse anxiety (P = 0.001), depression (P = 0.0026), and life satisfaction (P < 0.001) at 12 months post burn and worse body image at 6 (P < 0.001), 12 (P < 0.001), and 24 (P < 0.001) months post burn. The head-and-neck group had a significantly greater proportion of participants who had undergone contracture surgery at 12 months post burn (P < 0.001) and a smaller proportion who had returned to work by 6 (P < 0.001) and 12 (P < 0.001) months post burn. Conclusions: This study suggests that adults with head and neck burns might strongly benefit from additional counseling, psychotherapy, and greater aftercare.",
