    "Article Title": "Evaluating Educational and Employment Services for Young People With Psychiatric Conditions: A Systematic Review",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The authors conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating vocational interventions for young people with psychiatric conditions to determine the extent to which services were adapted for young people and whether services promoted gains in postsecondary education and employment. Methods: Five databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Sci-ence, Academic Search Premier, and ERIC) were searched. Sources eligible for inclusion were controlled studies published between 2000 and mid-2020 that evaluated a vocational intervention and examined postsecondary ed-ucational or employment outcomes for youths or young adults (ages 14-35 years) with psychiatric conditions. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Several of the studies evaluated services that were adapted for young people, including through the incorporation of educational supports. The most consistent finding was that services based on the individual placement and support (IPS) model improved employment outcomes more effectively than did comparison approaches and treatment as usual. Fewer studies assessed educational outcomes, and they yielded mixed results; however, recent findings from a controlled trial indicate that an enhanced IPS intervention that included well-specified supported education and skills training led to significantly superior outcomes in both education and employment. Conclusions: These results provide support for the efficacy of IPS-based services to improve employment outcomes among young people with psychiatric conditions and sug-gest that adapting IPS to include comprehensive educational supports and skills training may be important for efforts to improve postsecondary educational outcomes. Additional well-controlled intervention studies that examine educa-tional and longer-term outcomes should further inform the development and delivery of vocational services for this population.",
