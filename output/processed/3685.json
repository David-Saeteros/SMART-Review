    "Abstract": "Introduction: It takes a long time for someone to come to terms with a traumatic brachial plexus injury. The loss of function is akin to physical amputation of the limb, with all the associated body image and psychological effects (Waldram 2003). Numerous studies have been carried out that report on the functional outcomes following traumatic brachial plexus injury, but there is a noticeable lack of qualitative evidence that explores the subjective experiences of people following such an injury. The purpose of this study was to give these people a voice and allow researchers and occupational therapists to learn from the 'lived experiences' of those who had incurred such a devastating injury.Method: The research (undertaken by the first author) utilized a qualitative approach informed by phenomenology. This approach permitted the researcher to examine the core concepts of the lived experiences of people with this injury (Strauss 1990). Ten male Irish participants diagnosed with a traumatic brachial plexus injury were interviewed. Thematic analysis and member checking were utilized.Findings: The lack of rehabilitative and counselling services in the health care system was evident. Participants also voiced issues such as unequal opportunities in gaining employment, gender roles, the challenges of pain control, and the devastating effect of depression.Conclusion: The findings from this study will be of direct relevance to further development of services for individuals diagnosed with a traumatic brachial plexus injury.",
