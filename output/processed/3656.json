    "Abstract": "Introduction: The aging of the workforce necessitates preventive measures within the workplace to minimize its impact on health. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of an intervention program aimed at preventing psychophysical and cognitive aging in a working population and its relationship with the type of work and shift work.Methodology: A longitudinal and prospective comparative study was conducted on 273 workers in the chemical industry of the Autonomous Community of Murcia. The intervention consisted of a training, information, control, and monitoring program conducted from January 2019 to September 2021. The following parameters were assessed: manual grip strength, calf circumference, Frailty-Frail assessment, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Pfeiffer Cognitive Impairment Test, and Cognitive Reserve measured with the Cognitive Reserve Scale. The relationship of these variables with the type of work (manual and non-manual) and shift work was also examined. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 28.0, with significance set at p < 0.05.Results: Post-intervention, significant improvements were observed in Beck Depression Inventory scores among both manual and non-manual workers in all shifts (p < 0.001), as well as in Frailty-Frail scores among non-manual workers and those not working shifts (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the remaining variables, and there was no significant relationship with type of work or shift work (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Primary prevention intervention through an aging prevention program leads to improved outcomes, especially in the case of frailty and depression. Early intervention may help prevent the onset of psychophysical deterioration or, if not possible, facilitate early interventions that delay its progression.",
