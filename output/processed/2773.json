    "Abstract": "ObjectiveConduct a deep exploration of the outcomes that matter to people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and understand from their perspective how these outcomes can be achieved.Sample and MethodsIn-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Interviews were analysed using thematic frameworks, and a realist informed theories of change approach.ResultsOur study revealed the potential causal relationships between the context of a person's life, short-term goals and long-term outcomes. We provide a nuanced and detailed exploration of outcomes that matter for people with schizophrenia in relation to self-defined well-being. Achieving life milestones, feeling safe and outcomes related to improved physical health along with employment, a positive sense of self and psychosocial outcomes, were highly valued. For short- and long-term outcomes to be achieved, individuals required medication with minimal side-effects, cognitive behavioural therapy, family/social support and meaningful activities in their lives. Well-being was influenced by life context and short- and long-term outcomes, but in a circular nature also framed what short-term goals could be achieved.ConclusionsWorking with people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to identify and achieve better outcomes will necessitate a person-centred approach. This will require an appreciation of the relationship between the statutory and non-statutory resources that are available and a consideration of an individual's current well-being status. This approach acknowledges personal strengths and encourages ownership of goals and supports self-management.",
