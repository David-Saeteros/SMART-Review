    "Abstract": "Engagement in leisure is difficult for many community -dwelling adults post-stroke, resulting in increased sedentary and solitary leisure activity, and reduced leisure engagement and satisfaction. This, in turn, impacts long-term recovery, health, and quality of life. The aim of this study was to review the efficacy of in-home and community-based leisure education and leisure counseling on meaningful activity engagement and health outcomes for this population. A systematic review of the literature from 2005-2020 resulted in 2,017 references of which three met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicate that leisure education and leisure counseling improved quality of life, leisure satisfaction, autonomous leisure engagement, and leisure competence, as well as reduced depression and perceived barriers. Clinical implications and future research recommendations are provided.",
