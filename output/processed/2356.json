    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are anecdotal reports of high job turnover of Individual Placement and Support employment specialists. However, no studies have addressed this issue.OBJECTIVE: To explore whether turnover rates among employment specialists are higher compared to public sector employees along with the correlates of turnover intentions.METHODS: A repeated cross-sectional study collected data from 40 employment specialists in Norway using validated scales to measure job perceptions. Turnover intentions were the main outcome.RESULTS: Turnover rate of employment specialists (45.0%) was significantly higher than the average turnover rate of other occupations in the public sector (27.1%) in the same geographical regions (x(2) = 6.5, df = 1, p = 0.01). After adjusting for potential confounders, five factors remained significantly associated with turnover intentions in directions as expected: general job satisfaction (beta = -0.33, p < 0.05), satisfaction with current work (beta = -0.35, p < 0.05), satisfaction with supervision (beta = -0.28, p < 0.05), work meaningfulness (beta = -0.42, p < 0.05) and Negative emotionality personality trait (beta = 0.58, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Addressing turnover will positively impact on productivity and job satisfaction of employment specialists along with continuity of employment support for people with mental health conditions.",
