    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research is needed on how to optimize the return-to-work process for persons with mental health problems.OBJECTIVE: To develop a model that explains how employer and rehabilitation professional mental health literacy may influence strategies used in the return-to-work of persons with mental health problems.METHODS: A grounded theory study design was used to collect and analyse interview data from 23 employers and 22 rehabilitation professionals.RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four categories, illustrated in a conceptual process model: 1) seeing mental health problems through past experiences; 2) separating understandable and incomprehensible mental health problems; 3) balancing safeguarding one's personal interest with providing adequate support; and 4) facing conflicts and uncertainty in employee/service user return-to-work. A positional map of employer/rehabilitation types was created based on level of negative attitudes and uncertainty in supporting employees/service users and the employer in relation to the level of comprehensive understanding of mental health problems.CONCLUSIONS: Professional mental health literacy needs to be increased. Interventions need to be developed that provide employers with targeted support and knowledge in mental health literacy. Education on how to prevent and detect common mental health problems in the workplace is needed.",
