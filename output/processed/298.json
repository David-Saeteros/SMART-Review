    "Abstract": "Purpose: The present study was performed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, perceived benefits, and predictors of complementary health approaches use (CHA) in Turkish patients with mental disorders.Design and Methods: The present study was performed with 413 patients with mental disorders.Findings: In the present study, 62.2% of the patients had used CHA in the last 12 months. The most common types of CHA used were religious/spiritual activities and herbs. According to the multivariate logistic regression model, sex, education level, marital status, employment status, medical diagnoses, and duration of diagnoses were significantly associated with increased CHA use.Practice Implications: The CHA use by patients should be investigated, and education and counseling should be provided by health professionals to improve patient safety and patient outcomes.",
