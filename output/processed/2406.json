    "Abstract": "Unemployed and underemployed emerging adults (EAs) are at increased risk for depression. However, limited research has examined resilience and coping in this population. This study tested the resilience process by examining whether coping processes mediate the relationship between perceived stress and depression among unemployed and underemployed EAs. Data from 193 unemployed and underemployed EAs (ages 18-25) were collected through an online questionnaire. Path analysis tested the mediation model. Post hoc moderation analyses tested whether coping buffered the impact of stress on depression. The sample was diverse, consisting of Black (37%), White (37%), and other race/ethnicity (26%) participants. The proposed mediating model did not fit the data well. Of four interaction terms tested, one was significant (Perceived Stress x Coping Self-Efficacy [CSE];p= .043). As CSE increased, the relationship between perceived stress and depression decreased. The interaction results suggest that CSE buffers the relationship between perceived stress and depression.",
