    "Abstract": "Background: Increasing evidence suggests that clinician well-being influences patient, workforce, and organizational outcomes. Despite increasing attention to well-being among licensed clinicians (e.g., nurses and physicians), collective evidence about well-being among healthcare assistants, such as nursing and medical assistants, is limited. Healthcare assistants make up a substantial portion of the clinical workforce delivering direct patient care. The well-being of healthcare assistants is critical to ensure an ample workforce supply. The objective of this systematic review was to contribute a reproducible search, summary, appraisal, synthesis, and critique of the literature about well-being among healthcare assistants, including factors that induce or inhibit burnout, and to identify gaps in evidence that warrant future research. Methods: We performed a literature search across 4 databases with keywords using BOOLEAN operators. After an initial title and abstract screen, a search of relevant reference lists, and full text review was peformed independently by 2 researchers. Study quality was evaluated using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross -Sectional Studies. We extracted study characteristics, results, and deductively analyzed each study's alignment with the United States National Academy of Medicine's Clinician Well -Being Model. Results: We identified 28 articles meeting our inclusion criteria. Our synthesis indicated that most studies investigated personal factors (e.g., financial stressors or physical, emotional, and spiritual health) as opposed to organizational or policy factors (e.g., occupational policies or workplace culture) that may impact well-being. Younger workers and those with fewer years of experience appear to have higher burnout risk. Sleep health, improved unit -based culture (respect and increased decision -making with nurses), shorter shifts, and increased social support appear to be the most protective against burnout. Discussion: There remains a scarcity of evidence about factors impacting well-being among healthcare assistants. Existing literature focuses on individual, as opposed to external or organizational, contributory factors to burnout or well-being risk. Future studies should use specific methods to define and measure healthcare assistant roles, isolate harmful individual and organizational factors, and measure more specific sub -concepts of well-being such as depression. Such studies can contribute greatly to the overall understanding of healthcare assistant health and wellness, which subsequently may promote optimal patient and organizational outcomes.",
