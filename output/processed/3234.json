    "Abstract": "ObjectivesSpinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic event that may result in diminished physical, social, and mental health. The main objective of this research was to establish inpatient factors that contribute to social participation following discharge into the community.DesignProspective longitudinal design with measures taken three times, soon after admission to rehabilitation (N=88), at discharge from the inpatient phase (N=81) and 6months following discharge (N=71).MethodsParticipants included adults with SCI admitted into three SCI units over a 33-month period. Assessment included demographic, injury, and psychosocial health measures. Adjustment was defined by the extent of social re-integration or participation post-discharge after 6months in the community. Social participation was measured by the Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire (IPAQ). Logistic regression models were used to establish inpatient factors that significantly predicted social participation 6months post-discharge.ResultsSix months after discharge, around 55% of the sample had difficulties with social participation. The odds against being employed for an adult with poor social participation was found to be 8.4 to 1. Factors that predicted social participation included a younger age, having less severe secondary medical complications like bladder and bowel dysfunction, having a higher cognitive capacity, perceiving one has control (self-efficacy) over one's life and environment, and having greater perceived social support.ConclusionsThese results provide direction for enhancing existing psychosocial health strategies within SCI rehabilitation, affording an opportunity for every person who sustains a permanent SCI to have optimal capacity for social participation.",
