    "Article Title": "THE EFFECT OF PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION ON EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE: DEPRESSION-ANXIETY-STRESS, SENSE OF COHERENCE, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND WELL-BEING OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IN GREECE: AN INTERVENTION STUDY",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: Assessment of the impact of Jacobson Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) on depression-anxiety-stress symptoms, sense of coherence, health-related quality of life and well-being in long-term unemployed people with anxiety disorders.Design and setting: An intervention study was conducted at a relevant Organization, in Athens, Greece.Intervention: 50 long-term unemployed individuals suffering from anxiety disorders participated in the study. Participants were separated into two groups: (a) the intervention group (30 individuals) that was trained on an 8-week on Progressive Muscle Relaxation program and also received counseling services and (b) the control group (20 individuals) that received only counseling services.Main outcome measures: Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, Sense of Coherence, Health-Related Quality of Life and Well-being were evaluated at baseline and after the intervention.Results: Significant changes were noted in the studied variables between the two groups, with improved outcomes in the intervention group. The intervention group showed a decrease in the symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress (p < 0.001) [depression (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), stress (p < 0.001)], a higher score of sense of coherence (p < 0.001), improved health-related quality of life regarding the mental health domain (p < 0.001), and improvement in well-being (p < 0.001). No significant change was observed in the control group during the follow-up period.",
