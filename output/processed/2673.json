    "Article Title": "Impact of COVID-19 on Sleep, Anxiety, and Depression Among Medical Call Center Staff: Insights from a January 2021 Study",
    "Abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 outbreak emerged as a dual threat, effecting both the physical and mental well-being of healthcare staff. This study aimed to evaluate sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and the significant influencing factors during COVID-19 pandemic in 284 workers in a medical call center in January 2021. Material/Methods: Out of 443 pre-hospital care providers, 284 consented to participate. Data collection was done using an introductory information form, the PSQI for sleep quality, and the HADS for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Surveys were hosted on an online survey website and distributed via WhatsApp, with completed forms retrieved from the website. Results: Male sex (P=0.0001) and extended working hours in current workplace (P=0.017) were associated with higher HADS-A scores. Health problems, increased need for mental support, and poor job satisfaction correlated with lower HADS-D scores (P=0.025, P=0.005, P=0.0001, respectively) and higher PSQI scores (P=0.008, P=0.009, P=0.008, respectively). A moderately significant positive correlation was found between overall sleep quality and HADS-A (P=0.001, r=0.538) and HADS-D scores (P=0.001, r=0.493). Conclusions: The pandemic significantly impacted the mental health and sleep quality of frontline healthcare personnel, necessitating the identification and mitigation of adverse psychosocial factors. Implementing and evaluating psychoeducational programs and establishing multidisciplinary mental health teams can provide for essential support and counseling, promoting the well-being of healthcare staff and ensuring effective emergency care.",
