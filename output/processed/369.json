    "Article Title": "Employment Benefit Receipt Among Ontario Public Disability Benefit Recipients with a Disability Related to a Mental Disorder",
    "Abstract": "Using administrative data from the public long-term disability support program in Ontario, Canada, this paper examines the factors related to receipt of a paid employment benefit. These analyses include only ODSP beneficiaries who were primary beneficiaries, who had active files in March 2011 and who were < 65 years of age and had a disability-related primary diagnosis (n = 253,492). About 9 % of primary beneficiaries received the employment benefit. Logistic regression results suggest that compared to those who have a disability related to a physical disorder, those who have a psychotic disorder (OR 1.125), a mood disorder (OR 1.139) or a developmental disability (OR 1.618) are significantly more likely to receive the benefit while those who have a substance use disorder were significantly less likely (OR 0.540). These results indicate that a proportion of people who receives public disability benefits are employed. In addition, all things being equal, people with mental disorders are more likely to use this type of program than people with physical disorders.",
