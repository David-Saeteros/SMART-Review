    "Article Title": "The Moderating Role of Social Capital Between Parenting Stress and Mental Health and Well-Being Among Working Mothers in China",
    "Abstract": "Rapid economic growth has transformed social and family structure globally, including in China, over the past few decades. With women's engagement in the workforce, the dual demand of paid and domestic work has become a major source of stress, particularly among mothers. Working mothers face unique challenges of family obligations blended with contemporary values of women's career aspirations. Methods: This study recruited 189 participants. This study employed quantitative methods to investigate the relationship between parenting stress and mental health, and the moderating role of social capital, among working mothers in Zhaoqing, Guangdong province of China. Results: The findings suggested a high level of parenting stress among Chinese working mothers. Their stress is associated with depressive symptoms. What should be noted is that social capital acts as a moderator between their stress and depressive symptoms. Discussion: This study reveals the buffering effect of social capital against parenting stress and depression in Chinese working mothers, with an emphasis on the importance of workplace flexibility and social support systems in addressing work-family conflicts. The study enriches the study of the buffer effect of social capital on mental health. This knowledge can inform the development of targeted interventions and support systems to improve working mothers' overall well-being.",
