    "Article Title": "Predictors of change in sexual activity after cardiac diagnosis: Elements to inform sexual counseling",
    "Abstract": "Safely returning to sexual activity after being diagnosed with a cardiac condition is at the core of sexual counseling strategies. To further inform sexual counseling, this study examined changes in sexual activity before and after a cardiac diagnosis. Logistic analysis was used to suggest factors that can contribute to a change in sexual activity among cardiac patients. Reduced frequency in sexual activity after a cardiac diagnosis was influenced by greater sexual concerns and a history of smoking, as well as by education and employment status. These findings suggest that cardiac patients experiencing significant concerns about resuming sexual activity need added support through the mental health system.",
