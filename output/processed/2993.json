    "Article Title": "The impact of occupational accidents and gross domestic product on the sanctions imposed by the Greek OSH Inspectorate",
    "Abstract": "The Labour Inspectorate is a globally accepted institution with objectives and operational axes defined by the 81st International Labour Convention between Member States. The constantly changing conditions in the labour market make the need for a monitoring mechanism, to apply the provisions of labour law, more pronounced. Greek Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) inspectors, who are part of the Greek Labour Inspectorate, have an advisory, reconciliatory, auditory and prosecuting role in order to protect employees and employers. In this study, from the analysis of the data derived from all the published annual reports of Greek OSH Inspectorate for the period 2000-2013, a multiple regression model of the imposed sanctions based on occupational accidents and gross domestic product (GDP) is proposed. The statistical analysis reveals a positive correlation between occupational accidents and sanctions imposed by Greek OSH Inspectors, and a negative correlation between GDP and sanctions. Our findings can assist OSH authorities to deal with challenges in the new world of work in the period of economic recession.",
