    "Abstract": "Background: Previous studies have suggested that lymphoma survivors commonly display altered Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Because these were predominantly cross-sectional studies, the dynamic of events as well as the factors which influence HRQoL remain to be determined.Methods: We conducted a prospective study on a cohort of 204 Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors who remained disease-free 2 years after undergoing chemotherapy (referred to the M0-M12-M24 periods).Results: We found that although Physical and Mental Component Scores (PCS and MCS) of HRQoL significantly improved from M0 to M24 in the vast majority of patients (favorable group), approximately 20% of patients displayed severe alterations in HRQoL (global SF-36 scores < 50) extending over the 2-year period (unfavorable group). Low M24 PCSs were associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, cardiovascular events and neuropathy. In contrast social determinants, comorbidity and infections, as well as several other parameters related to the disease or to the treatment itself were not associated with low M24 PCSs. Low M24 MCSs were associated with a low educational level, aggressive histology, infections, cardiovascular events and PTSS. However, the most predictive risk factor for low SF-36 scores at M24 was a low SF-36 score at M12. The unfavorable group also displayed a low incidence of return to work.Conclusions: Although the HRQoL of lymphoma survivors generally improved over time, persistent and severe HRQoL alterations still affected approximately one fifth of patients, resulting in important social consequences. This specific group, which presents with identifiable risk factors, may benefit from early, targeted psycho-social support.",
