    "Abstract": "This study examined factors related to poor mental health in caregivers assisting service members and Veterans (SMV) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants were 201 military caregivers (96.0% female; Age: M = 39.2 years, SD = 10.2) of SMVs following a mild, moderate, severe, or penetrating TBI. The SF-36v2 Health Survey, Caregiver Appraisal Scale, Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4, and Caregiver Questionnaire were completed. Caregivers were divided into two mental health groups: Poor Mental Health (n = 108) and Good Mental Health (n = 93). Factors related to poor caregiver mental health were worse general health and stress appraisal, less personal time, unmet needs, and greater financial and employment strain. Factors also related to poor caregiver mental health included assisting a SMV who had sustained a mild TBI, did not have significant hospital care, had post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and/or anxiety, was experiencing greater functional disability, and was experiencing physical expressions of irritability, anger, and aggression (all p's<.05; d =.29 to d =.64; OR = 1.911 to OR = 4.984). For many military caregivers, poor mental health may be related to the SMVs ongoing comorbid mental health symptoms and less so neurological impairment related to the brain injury. TBI treatment programs require a holistic approach that addresses the behavioral health concerns of both SMVs and their caregivers.",
