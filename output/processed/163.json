    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate cost-effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and workplace dialogue intervention (WDI), both as stand-alone interventions and in combination, compared with treatment as usual (TAU), for employees on sickness absence with mental disorders. Methods: Employees (n = 352, 78.4% females) on sickness absence were randomized to one of four groups. Cost-utility analyses were conducted from a health care perspective and a limited societal perspective. Results: All groups reported significant improvements in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and there were no significant differences in HRQoL or costs between groups. The probability of costeffectiveness for ACTthornWDI was 50% compared with ACT, indicating that both treatment alternatives could be considered equally favorable for decision- makers. TAU and WDI were rejected due to less economic efficiency. Conclusion: Adding WDI to ACT cannot be recommended on the basis of our study results.",
