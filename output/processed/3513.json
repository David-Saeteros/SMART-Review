    "Article Title": "The Impact of Demographic Characteristics on Parenting Stress among Parents of Children with Disabilities: A Cross-Sectional Study",
    "Abstract": "Even though it is already known that parents of children with developmental delays or disabilities experience higher parenting stress than families of typically developing children, the contributing factors need to be analyzed in more detail. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the influence of demographic characteristics on parenting stress from caring for a disabled child and to identify possible protective or additional stressful social factors. A total of 611 mothers and fathers of children with developmental delays, chronic diseases, or disabilities completed two questionnaires during their medical appointments at the Children's Development Center (CDC) of Leipzig University Hospital between June 2020 and February 2021. These consisted of the German versions of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) and the Impact on Family Scale (IOFS). To determine differences between the various groups, we used parametric and non-parametric tests. Mothers and single parents are significantly more strained than fathers and non-single parents. Parents with vocational training, those who graduated with a higher-level diploma, and those within employment report a higher financial burden. While unemployed and full-time workers experience the lowest stress, parents who work part-time or exclusively take care of their child show higher levels of stress. Looking at the age of the child, parents of children of young primary school age are the most stressed, and those of infants are the least stressed. These findings suggest that mothers and single parents especially should receive more support, and parents need to be provided with more attention during their child's entry into school. Possible limitations and the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.",
