    "Abstract": "Objectives This study was conducted to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric trainees and early career psychiatrists in Iran. Methods In this cross-sectional survey, the authors used a 24-item questionnaire inquiring about the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, their views on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their professional careers, methods of education, workplace environment, well-being and mental health, and the use of telepsychiatry in Iran. Results A total of 159 responses were received. The majority (n=124, 78.0%) reported that some but not all obligatory activities have been converted to online activities. Most of the participants (n=103, 64.8%) stated that the pandemic had not affected the duration of their training. Less than half (n=61, 38.4%) reported that their well-being had been affected rather negatively. Some (n=59, 37.1%) reported that their supervisors or coworkers had no significant impact on their well-being, whereas others (n=53, 33.3%) reported a rather positive impact. Almost half of the participants (n=78, 49.0%) did not have access to free psychological counseling. In addition, more than half (n=89, 56.0%) reported that there were no recommendations on how to proceed with telepsychiatry. Conclusions This study calls for improvements in the education and well-being of psychiatric trainees and early career psychiatrists in Iran amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional research should be carried out to maximize learning, provide mental health care, and use telepsychiatry.",
