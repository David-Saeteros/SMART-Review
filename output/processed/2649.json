    "Abstract": "Purpose A substantial portion of breast cancer survivors are active in the workforce, yet factors that allow survivors to balance work with cancer management and to return to work are poorly understood. We examined breast cancer survivors' most valued/desired types of support in early survivorship.Methods Seventy-six employed breast cancer survivors answered an open-ended survey question assessing the most valued/desired support to receive from healthcare providers during early survivorship to manage work and health. Cutrona's (Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology 9:3-14, 1990) optimal matching theory and House's (1981) conceptualization of social support types informed our analyses. Data were content-analyzed to identify themes related to support, whether needed support was received or not, and the types of healthcare providers who provided support.Results We identified six themes related to types of support. Informational support was valued and mostly received by survivors, but they expected more guidance related to work. Emotional support was valued but lacking, attributed mainly to providers' lack of personal connection and mental health support. Instrumental (practical) support was valued but received by a small number of participants. Quality of life support to promote well-being and functionality was valued and often received. Other themes included non-specific support and non-support.Conclusions This study expands our understanding of how breast cancer survivors perceive work-related support from healthcare professionals. Findings will inform targeted interventions designed to improve the support provided by healthcare professionals. Implications for Cancer Survivors Breast cancer survivors managing work and health challenges may benefit by having their unmet support needs fulfilled.",
