    "Article Title": "Community Rehabilitation clack for for Youth with Psychosis Spectrum Disorders",
    "Abstract": "Recovery-oriented treatment for youth with psychosis goes beyond a symptom and deficit-amelioration model, promoting engagement and functioning within the community. Given the challenges young people with psychosis face, early psychosis treatment programs often integrate rehabilitative components targeting functional outcomes. The current article reviews 4 community rehabilitation programs in early psychosis: care coordination, cognitive rehabilitation, supported education and employment, and peer support. For each of these rehabilitative intervention programs, we discuss challenges faced by youth with psychosis, clinical intervention practices, the current state of evidence, and clinical and/or research considerations.",
