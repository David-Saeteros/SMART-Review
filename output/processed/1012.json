    "Article Title": "Peer Support Specialists' Experiences of Microaggressions",
    "Abstract": "Microaggressions and their consequences have been observed among people with mental illness. However, little is known about ways in which peer support specialists, those with lived experience who also provide mental health services, experience microaggressions or the impacts of these experiences. Using an online survey of open-ended questions, peer support specialists (N = 65) provided examples of microaggressions they have experienced on the job and described the frequency of these experiences, the content of messages they received, and their responses and coping strategies. Data were coded using directed content analysis. Participants across a wide range of facilities and geographic locations reported experiencing microaggressions in the workplace. The content of microaggressions fell into 2 domains: (1) negative messages about the nature of having a mental illness and disclosing this information to others and (2) negative messages about the role of peer support specialists. Peers' responses to microaggressions included feeling isolated, seeking social support, employing coping strategies, and demonstrating resiliency and increased motivation to do peer work. Some peers, however, also reported leaving positions due to these experiences. Findings indicate that microaggressions are a common experience for peer support specialists that can have a detrimental impact on their sense of self and role as mental health specialists. Despite this, peers sought out support, identified coping strategies, and exhibited resiliency. Findings have implications for ways to better support peers in their roles as support specialists.",
