    "Abstract": "Introduction: Employment is an important health protective factor but also entails workplace psychosocial risks with multiple impacts on health. Objective: The present study aimed at examining the association between employment position and subjective health in a relatively homogenous sample of public servants with mostly tertiary degrees. Method: Online health survey was conducted among employees of two large public institutes in a large city in Hungary. The questionnaire contained items on demographic data, health status, mental health, health behaviour, and work-related questions including employment position (leadership). Data analysis was carried out by employment position in two (manager, subordinate) and three (manager, subordinate with college degree, subordinate with no college degree) strata. Results: Subjective health, satisfaction with life, sense of coherence, pathological stress, sickness absence, social support in the workplace and private life were most favourable among those in leadership position. Work ability did not differ by employment position, but sleep time was significantly less favourable (shorter) among leaders compared to subordinates. Subordinates with no college degree had the worst measures of health. Conclusion: Employment position is related to individual socioeconomic status and workplace psychosocial stress, therefore research on workplace stress should include employment level as a potential confounder. Psychosocial stress at workplaces should be monitored for which various recommendations are available. The simplest method is to monitor mid-and long-term turnover and sickness absence stratified for employment position and proportionate to the workforce.",
