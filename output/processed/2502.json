    "Abstract": "This study investigates the implications of acquiring vision impairment later in life on the effect of social support among adults with acquired vision impairment in Nigeria. It further explores the importance of maintaining social contact after vision loss which serves as the structural aspect of social support needed for adaptation to vision loss. A qualitative study using a phenomenological approach was undertaken. Eight adults (18- 59years) were recruited from disability service organizations in Nigeria. Telephone interviews were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was used to analyse the data gathered in this study. Three broad themes were developed from participants' accounts of their experiences: (1) diminishment in social contact and social support from friends, romantic partners, and others; (2) negative changes in social support at workplace; and (3) increased social support from family members. The findings indicate that participants experienced diminished social contact and negative social support from friends, colleagues, and employers at the workplace. However, participants experienced increased social contact and positive social support from family members in the form of tangible and effective support. As social connectedness are highly valued in Nigeria's diverse society, we suggest that adults with acquired vision impairment would significantly benefit from support services that would assist these individuals to build and maintain their social contact or networks providing a platform for positive social support.",
