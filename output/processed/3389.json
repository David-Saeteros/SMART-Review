    "Abstract": "Few studies evaluated coping strategies in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) in relation to annualized relapse rate (ARR) and lesion load (LL). Overall, results might have been influenced by the inclusion of depressed patients. To investigate the coping strategies and their association to disease activity, we studied relapsing-remitting pwMS accurately selected to avoid the confounding effect of depression. Sixty-seven relapsing-remitting pwMS and 67 healthy subjects (HS) underwent to Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (I-COPE) and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situation (CISS) and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Cognitive performances, ARR, physical disability and magnetic resonance imaging T2-LL were assessed for correlation with coping and depression scores. pwMS showed lower scores than HSs on social support and turning to religion subscales of I-COPE and on emotion dimension of CISS. In pwMS, higher ARR was related to higher positive attitude and lower score on the turning to religion subscale of I-COPE. The present study revealed a less employment of emotion-based coping strategies in pwMS. A scarce use of faith for support and a frequent adoption of a positive attitude were associated with an increase of MS activity in terms of ARR.",
