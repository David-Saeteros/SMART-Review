    "Abstract": "This study explored resources from paid employment that could promote women's health during a vulnerable period of motherhood (raising young children). Following theoretical perspectives on work-family interplay and stress, it tested two sets of hypotheses by applying cross-lagged modeling techniques to nationally representative data on mothers from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (n = 7450) and occupational conditions from the Occupational Information Network database. In general, mothers of young children reported better health when employed in occupational sectors with more socioemotional resources, such as opportunities to develop a sense of mastery and connection. For the specific set of mothers who had children with health problems, more instrumental resources on the job, such as the ability to telecommute, appeared to better support health. There was some evidence of resources mattering more in the context of part-time employment, but there were no links between any resources and mental health.",
