    "Abstract": "This study aimed to examine the relationship between mindfulness and the request for job accommodations among individuals with disabilities. One hundred fifty individuals with disabilities who needed a job accommodation completed a survey assessing the cognitive, affective, and mindfulness factors involved with requesting job accommodations. Pearson correlations were calculated between scales and subscales measuring mindfulness, positive affect, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and intentions to request accommodations. The results showed significant correlations between mindfulness and all other scales. In addition, multiple regression and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the impacts of cognitive, affective, and mindfulness factors on an individual's intention and decision to request or withhold a request for an accommodation. Mindfulness was not found significant in predicting the intention to request accommodations; however, positive affect, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations accounted for 35% of the variance in intention to request. The interaction between mindfulness and intention to request, along with self-efficacy, was found significant in predicting request behavior. Mindfulness and the interaction between mindfulness and intention to request contributed an additional 8% of the variance in requesting behavior. The results of this study indicate the need for more research into the relationship of mindfulness and the decision to request accommodations.",
