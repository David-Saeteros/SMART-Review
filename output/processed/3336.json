    "Article Title": "The personality profile of IPS employment specialists, and how it relates to job satisfaction: A longitudinal cohort study",
    "Abstract": "The role of the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) employment specialist is a new type of occupation within mental healthcare. High turnover among employment specialists necessitates improvement in their recruitment and retention. One element that impacts retention is job satisfaction. We assessed the personality of 38 employment specialists (Big 5 Inventory-2) and measured job satisfaction over three time periods. Compared to norm data, employment specialists were significantly higher on Extraversion (Delta T = 8.0, CI: 5.59-10.42), Agreeableness (Delta T = 7.8, CI: 5.56-10.12), Conscientiousness (Delta T = 3.3, CI: 0.8-5.84), Open-mindedness (Delta T = 3.5, CI: 0.97-6.07), while lower on Negative emotionality (Delta T = -3.5, CI: -6.5 to -0.42). Extraversion had a substantial longitudinal positive effect on job satisfaction (beta at T1 = 0.39; CI: 0.10-0.73) (beta at T2 = 0.40; CI: 0.03-0.80), while Negative emotionality - a substantial negative effect (beta at T1 = -0.60; CI: -0.90 to -0.30) (beta at T2 = -0.50; CI: -0.90 to -0.12). Male gender was significantly associated with higher job satisfaction at the time point 1 (beta = -0.46; CI: -0.80 to -0.14). Age, length of employment in the role, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Open-mindedness were not found to have substantial significant effects on job satisfaction of employment specialists. Recruiting employment specialists who score high on Extraversion and low on Negative emotionality may be a good fit for the role and job satisfaction.",
