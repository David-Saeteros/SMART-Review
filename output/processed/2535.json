    "Abstract": "Background: Understanding the psychological well-being (PWB) of university staff and factors that influence it is critical for developing intervention programs that promote PWB and enhance productivity and worker engagement.Purpose: This study aimed to assess the level of PWB in university staff and identify personal, social, and workplace environmental factors related to their PWB.Methods: A cross-sectional, correlational study design was used. A convenience sample of university staff was recruited from two universities in Texas. Participants completed an online questionnaire, which included Ryff's PWB scale to measure PWB, along with questions related to personal, social, and workplace factors. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the influence of these factors on the PWB of university staff.Results: The PWB of university staff (n = 202) was significantly influenced by personal factors (i.e., race and perceived mental health status), social factors (i.e., social support of friends), and workplace environmental factors (i.e., physical demands).Conclusion/Application to Practice: To effectively promote PWB among university staff, occupational health nurses should proactively track and monitor their PWB. Policies and interventions should consider the various personal, social, and workplace environment factors identified in this study, such as mental health, social support resources, and physical demands.",
