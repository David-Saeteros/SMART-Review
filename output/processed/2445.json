    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychosocial well-being in the workplace may increase retention of oncology nurses, while a lack of social support has been a predictor of occupational stress in nurses.PURPOSE: To further explore this phenomenon by examining the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support in Greek nurses working in oncology and mental health settings.METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 150 nurses (70 oncology nurses and 80 mental health nurses) from the area of greater Athens who joined the study. The scale was translated to Greek using the forward-backward procedure. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support's internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha), stability (intraclass correlation coefficient), factor structure (factor analysis), and convergent validity (correlation with Ways of Coping Questionnaire) were examined.RESULTS: A three-factor (significant others, family, and friends) model was confirmed. The subscales representing the three factors demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alphas>.90) and stability intraclass correlation coefficient (>.90).CONCLUSIONS: The measure is reliable and valid, and it can be used to assess nurses' social support; the results of such an assessment could be helpful when selecting strategies for assisting nurses.",
