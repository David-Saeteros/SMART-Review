    "Article Title": "Health Care Worker Burnout During the COVID-19 Pandemic in HIV Clinics in Guangxi, China: A Cross-sectional Analysis of Risk and Protective Factors",
    "Abstract": "Dual epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and HIV cause burnout among HIV health care workers. Guided by a socioecological framework, we investigated risk and protective factors of their burnout in Guangxi, China based on an online survey (N = 1,029) from April to May 2020. Descriptive and bivariate analyses and hierarchical regression were conducted. COVID-19-related stressors (B = 0.648 [0.482-0.816], p < .001), challenges while delivering HIV services (B = 0.236 [0.174-0.298], p < .001), and working in province/city-level institutes (B = 2.302, [0.828-3.776], p =.002) were risk factors. Protective factors were resilience (B = -0.596 [-0.687 to -0.504], p < .001), workplace social support (B = -0.410 [-0.717 to -0.044], p =.03), and institutional responsiveness to COVID-19 (B = -0.138 [-0.205 to -0.071], p < .001), respectively. Burnout-related interventions may benefit from promoting resilience, creating a supportive work environment, and strengthening institutional response to public health emergencies.",
