    "Article Title": "Lifetime Experiences of Violence Among Mental Health Professionals",
    "Abstract": "Cases of violence towards health professionals have been increasingly appearing in media and research; on the other hand, there is not enough information about professionals who provide mental health services in related fields. In this study, lifetime experiences of exposure to violence among mental health professionals in Turkey have been examined. This study had a general descriptive model and data was collected from 781 professionals via an online survey application. Participants of the current study had a mean age of 31. They were mostly female (84%) and from the fields of psychology/clinical psychology (50%) and psychological counseling (44%). In a questionnaire developed by researchers, participants were asked about their lifetime experiences of any of the seven different types of violence, its source, impact, and outcomes as well as reception of psychological support. Participants most frequently reported exposure to verbal violence, emotional violence, physical violence, neglect, social-societal violence, sexual violence, and economic violence, respectively. Friend was the most commonly cited source of violence where most participants reported showing a reaction but not receiving psychological support. The most commonly reported effect of violence was reduced feeling of self-worth. In the light of these findings; programs, applications, and interventions that take personal histories of violence into account should be developed for those individuals from mental health fields who mostly serve victims of violence.",
