    "Article Title": "Treatment Adherence in Youth with First-Episode Psychosis: Impact of Family Support and Telehealth Delivery",
    "Abstract": "Mental health-care delivery to young people with first-episode schizophrenia presents significant challenges especially in underserved areas. This chart review reveals the importance of family support as a predictor for medication and treatment adherence with this vulnerable group. An unexpected disengagement rate of 47% was discovered. It was further discovered that receiving care with telehealth delivery was a significant predictor of lost to follow-up or treatment nonadherence. Recommendations include psychoeducation for families during the initial crisis, initiation of long-acting injectable antipsychotics early in care, a hybrid telehealth intervention with in-home medication delivery, and collaboration with educational, vocational county agencies for employment support. A system of care must be developed to support young people with this severe illness for optimum outcome and protection of long-term cognitive functioning.",
