    "Abstract": "Traditionally, the Roma People has found within their families their greatest strength to adapt to an adverse environment. This study explores the respective contribution of the context (neighborhood quality and social support), the family system (coherence and adaptability) and the individual (subjective well-being) on the resilience of parental figures from a psychosocial and community perspective. The participants were 95 Roma families residing in the Canary Islands and 16 social workers, whose responses were submitted to a descriptive analysis and hierarchical linear regression. The families live in neighborhoods with social inequalities due to their low education, precarious employment and the few formal supports obtained. The parental figures perceive a good family cohesion and a good level of subjective well-being. The regression model on resilience shows the negative contribution of the social problems of the neighborhood, and the positive contribution of stable economic income, living in an inclusive neighborhood, enjoying good family cohesion and achieving a good level of subjective wellbeing. In conclusion, the Roma families present strengths and potentials that, together with the appropriate community supports, guarantee a normalizing resilience in which they continue to preserve those family values that allowed their survival in difficult times.",
