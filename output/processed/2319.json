    "Abstract": "Introduction: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers (HCWs) globally. This study investigated potential factors related to depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of Chinese HCWs during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic.Methods: An online survey was distributed to Chinese HCWs using respondent-driven sampling. Data were collected between February 13th and February 20th, 2020, immediately following the COVID-19 contagion peak in Hubei. A total of 1208 respondents were eligible for analysis. Mental health problems and social support were measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSS).Results: The prevalence rates of depression, (DASS-depression > 9) anxiety (DASS-anxiety > 7) and stress (DASS-stress > 14) were 37.8%, 43.0% and 38.5%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regressions revealed that stress, anxiety, and depression were positively related to lower levels of social support, longer working hours, discrimination experience and workplace violence. The scarcity of medical equipment was correlated with increased stress and depression. Chinese HCWs working at COVID 19 designated hospitals were more likely to report anxiety. Additionally, volunteering to work in the frontline health facilities was inversely associated with depression.Conclusion: Mental health problems among Chinese HCWs were alarming during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Health facilities require appropriate and standing services that address the mental health of healthcare workers, particularly during epidemic outbreaks.",
