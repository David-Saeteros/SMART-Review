    "Abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurological disorders that is difficult to predict and prevent in the world. In parallel to the physiological effects of MS, the unpredictable changes involved in the illness influence the process of planning for the future. From this point of view, this study is intended to examine the career trajectory of people with MS. To better understand how MS-related changes impact the career trajectories of people with MS, interviews were completed with 10 individuals with MS living and working in Turkey with a focus on the career development process. The results indicate that people with MS experience physical, mental, and psychological symptoms and career barriers; however, they adjust to these symptoms with some strengths and coping strategies. The most common career path in this study is continuing, which means participants tried to deal with their illnesses, and stated their wish to be promoted in their fields by meeting the requirements. Finally, participants also reported receiving support from different resources such as family, supervisors, and colleagues and having altruistic values.",
