    "Abstract": "Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people lacked access to group fitness opportunities due to elevated risk of infection, lockdown, and closure of exercise facilities. Additionally, many people experienced higher than average rates of mental health burden (eg, anxiety and stress). To help address these needs, an existing in-person community exercise class, taught by a faculty member from an academic medical center, transitioned to an online synchronous (OS) physical fitness class via the Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) videoconferencing platform. As such, the instructor advertised the OS fitness classes through an existing email list of community members and university faculty, staff, students, or alumni email listservs. This telewellness intervention sought to create a sense of community, build social support, and promote physical and mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Our aim was to determine the perceived mental and physical health benefits of attending an OS fitness class for community members, including health care workers. We also assessed the use and functionality of related technologies necessary for delivering and attending the fitness classes. Methods: An online survey questionnaire was created and tested to collect quantitative and qualitative data for an exploratory study. Data were collected to evaluate the fitness class, motivation, perceived health benefits, and related technologies. A convenience sample of people who had participated in the OS fitness classes was recruited for this study via an emailed recruitment flyer. Results: A total of 51 participants accessed and completed the survey questionnaire. Survey participants consisted of 28 of 51 (55%) with a university affiliation, 17 of 51 (33%) with no university affiliation, and 6 of 51 (12%) who declined to state. The largest group of participants reporting full-time employment (18/51, 35%) also reported university affiliation with the academic medical center. In this group, 13 of 51 (25%) participants reported full-time employment, university affiliation, and doctoral degrees. High overall exercise class satisfaction was observed in the survey responses (mean 4.0, SD 1). Data analyses revealed significant perceived value of both mental and physical health benefits as motivating factors for participating in the OS fitness class. Challenges were identified as not being able to receive individual feedback from the instructor and the inability of some participants to see if they were in sync with the rest of the class. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary support for the use of online videoconferencing fitness platforms to promote wellness and facilitate group exercise in the community during times of high infection risk. Future studies should continue to explore perceived benefits, mental and physical wellness, best practices, and the design of related technologies.",
