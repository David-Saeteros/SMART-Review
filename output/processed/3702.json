    "Abstract": "Objectives This study investigates race-ethnic differences among older non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic adults' financial, employment, and stress consequences of COVID-19. Methods We use data from the Health and Retirement Study, including the 2020 COVID-panel, to evaluate a sample of 2,929 adults using a combination of bivariate tests, OLS regression analysis, and moderation tests. Results Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black older adults experienced more financial hardships, higher levels of COVID-19 stress, and higher rates of job loss associated with COVID-19 relative to their Non-Hispanic White counterparts. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19 resilience resources, yet, these resources were not protective of the consequences of COVID-19. Discussion Understanding how the experiences of managing and coping with COVID-19 stressors differ by race-ethnicity can better inform intervention design and support services.",
