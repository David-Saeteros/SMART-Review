    "Abstract": "Aim. The objective of this study was to test the psychometric properties of selected scales, namely, Decision Latitude, Psychological Job Demand, Social Support and Job Insecurity, from the Polish version of Karasek's 29-item Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Method. The study covered 2626 workers from a wide range of occupations. Estimation of internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha, and both exploratory factor analysis (with principal axis method) and confirmatory factor analysis were the main statistical methods. Predictive validity was assessed by regressing the outcomes of JCQ scales on the outcomes of Goldberg and Williams's General Health Questionnaire. Results. The internal consistency of the scales was satisfactory, ranging from .60 to .85. The 4-dimensional structure of the measured version was generally confirmed; the 4 dimensions being Decision Latitude; Psychological Job Demands and Job Insecurity merged into I factor; Co-workers' Social Support; and Supervisors' Social Support. Fit indexes for this model were satisfactory, it was also proved that this model predicted mental health. Conclusions. The Polish version of Karasek's 29-item JCQ has satisfactory psychometric properties; it is a short, easy method for assessing psychosocial work conditions.",
