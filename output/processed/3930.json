    "Abstract": "Purpose: We aimed to analyse the impact of psychosocial work environment on non-work-related sickness absence (NWRSA) among a prospective cohort study, stratified using a random sampling technique.Methods: Psychosocial variables were assessed among 15,643 healthy workers using a brief version of the Spanish adaptation of Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire. A one year follow-up assessed the total count of NWRSA days. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used for multivariate analyses.Results: After adjusting for covariates, low levels of job control and possibilities for development (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% Cl: 1.01-136 [men]; OR: 1.39 95% Cl: 1.09-1.77 [women]), poor social support and quality of leadership (OR: 1.29; 95% Cl: 1.11-1.50 [men]; OR: 1.28; 95% Cl: 1.01-1.63 [women]), and poor rewards (OR: 1.34; 95% Cl: 1.14-1.57 [men]; OR: 1.30; 95% Cl: 1.01-1.66 [women]) predicted a total count of sickness absence greater than zero, in both men and women. Double presence was also significantly associated with NWRSA different than 0, but only among women (OR: 1.40; 95% Cl: 1.08-1.81). Analyses found no association between psychosocial risk factors at work and the total count (i.e., number of days) of sickness absences.Conclusions: The results suggest that work-related psychosocial factors may increase the likelihood of initiating an NWRSA episode, but were not associated with the length of the sickness absence episode. Among our large cohort we observed that some associations were gender-dependent, suggesting that future research should consider gender when designing psychosocial interventions aimed at decreasing sickness absences.
