    "Article Title": "Postpartum Depression in Fathers and Associated Risk Factors: A Systematic Review",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The postpartum period is a process that affects mothers and fathers mentally. In this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the literature on postpartum depression and elucidate the factors associated with depression in fathers/men; and eventually to draw attention to the subject.Methods: A literature search was conducted between April-May 2019 including qualitative and quantitative research articles published between 2009-2019 in Pubmed, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Turkish Psychiatric Index and Ulakbim Medical Databases. A total of 18 articles in English (n = 17) and Turkish (n = 1) were included.Results: The majority of studies were quantitative (n=17) and 1 had a qualitative design. 22.2% were carried out in the Americas, 61.1% in Europe and 16.7% in Asia. In 16 of the studies, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale was used to diagnose postpartum depression in fathers, and 4 of them assessed psychometric properties. According to the results of the findings, unemployment, age, economic status and social support were among the factors affecting postpartum depression in fathers.Conclusion: Besides the factors affecting the mothers such as age, education, social support, whether the pregnancy was planned, parenting stress, parental stress/sense of competence, quality of the relationship with the spouse, history of depression, number of people living at home; factors such as housing status, economic situation and unemployment affect postnatal depression in fathers. Since there was only one research article from Turkey, we believe that there is a need for research on this subject in our country.",
