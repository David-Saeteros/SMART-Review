    "Article Title": "The Role of Personal, Professional, and Psychological Factors in Therapists' Resilience",
    "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the factors that help therapists maintain their resilience to work stressors. Participants were Greek mental health practitioners (N = 163) who were approached through the National Organization of Psychotherapy in Greece as well as through several Greek online professional groups. Participants completed online measures of professional quality of life, counseling self-efficacy, empathy, and the five dimensions of Seligman's well-being model (positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishment). Results showed that almost all well-being factors yielded significant relationships with compassion satisfaction, burnout and secondary traumatic stress. Meaning had the most influence predicting the three criterion variables, while positive emotions and relationships predicted the level of burnout. Counseling self-efficacy significantly predicted compassion satisfaction while empathy predicted the level of secondary traumatic stress. Finally, workplace setting was a significant predictor of burnout. The study suggests that positive psychology concepts are useful variables in the mental health professionals' resilience field. Particularly meaning, positive emotions, and satisfaction with relationships might play an important role in the development of strategies for improving therapists' mental health and functioning.",
