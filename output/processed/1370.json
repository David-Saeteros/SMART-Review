    "Article Title": "Evaluation of a Cognitive Remediation Intervention for College Students With Psychiatric Conditions",
    "Abstract": "Objective: Given the poor educational outcomes associated with psychiatric conditions, we developed Focused Academic Strength Training (FAST), a 12-week strategy-focused cognitive remediation intervention designed to improve academic functioning among college students with psychiatric conditions. Here we report initial results from a randomized controlled trial of FAST. Method: Seventy-two college students with mood, anxiety, and/or psychotic disorders were randomized to receive FAST or services as usual and were assessed at baseline and 4 months (posttreatment). Results: Repeated-measures analyses of variance indicated FAST-associated improvements in self-reported cognitive strategy use (p < .001), self-efficacy (p = .001), and academic difficulties (p = .025). There were no significant treatment-related improvements in neuropsychological performance. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: FAST may lead to an increase in self-efficacy and cognitive strategy use, as well as a reduction in academic difficulties among students with psychiatric conditions. Future analyses with follow-up data through 12 months will address the potential of FAST to improve academic functioning among this population.",
