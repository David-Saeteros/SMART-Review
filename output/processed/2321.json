    "Article Title": "Longitudinal study of stress, social support, and depression in married Arab immigrant women",
    "Abstract": "Using a stress and social support framework, this study explored the trajectory of depression in 388 married Arab immigrant women. The women provided three panels of data approximately 18months apart. Depression at Time 3 was regressed on Time 1 depression, socio-demographic variables, and rate of change over time in stress and social support. The regression model was significant and accounted for 41.16% of the variation in Time 3 depression scores. Time 1 depression, English reading ability, husband's employment status, changes over time in immigration demands, daily hassles, and social support from friends were associated with Time 3 depression.",
