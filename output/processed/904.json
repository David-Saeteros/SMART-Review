    "Article Title": "Modification of the Individual Placement and Support Model of Supported Employment",
    "Abstract": "Individual placement and support (IPS) is a robust evidence-based model of supported employment for people with mental health conditions that has been implemented in high-income countries. The model is now being extended to new populations and settings, often with modifications. Current evidence indicates that minor modifications may increase fit, major alterations of core principles gener-ally reduce effectiveness, and augmentations have mixed success. The authors recommend that those who imple-ment IPS adhere to its core principles whenever possible, use standardized methods to document and assess modifica-tions, and follow basic scientific procedures to develop, measure, and evaluate modifications before recommending policy changes.",
