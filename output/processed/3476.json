    "Abstract": "PurposeThe growing number of athletes diagnosed with cancer requires a better understanding of their background, experiences, and specific goals to provide personalized care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of collegiate athletes in the United States diagnosed with cancer, reflecting on various barriers and challenges because of their cancer diagnosis, as they relate to their athletic participation and educational experiences.MethodsThis qualitative study used a phenomenological approach to study the nature and states of lived experiences in collegiate athlete cancer survivors diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 10 and 39 years old. Eighteen collegiate athlete cancer survivors (14 females and 4 males) participated in semi-structured interviews.ResultsThe mean age at the time of the interviews was 22.3 +/- 1.6 years. Seventeen participants (94%) identified as white/Caucasian. Five themes related to challenges emerged from the interviews: (1) academic challenges, (2) athletic challenges, (3) gaps in support, (4) side effects, and (5) mental health challenges. The mental health needs of collegiate athlete cancer survivors have been notably reported.ConclusionAs research on young cancer survivors increases, there is an opportunity for a deeper understanding of their lived experiences. The themes that emerged from this study are important and meaningful to increase the educational and athletic support as well as the mental and physical health of these survivors.",
