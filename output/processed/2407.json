    "Abstract": "A major recovery milestone for youth affected by psychosis is reintegration back into a school setting, an important, attainable, treatment goal. The emergence of psychosis often results in either an onset or exacerbation of prior neurocognitive and learning challenges for affected students. Gold standard practice in clinical care for psychosis comprises comprehensive supportive educational services explicitly focused on successful academic reintegration and achievement. This article discusses how providers can guide school teams and their institutions to identify psychosis in their student populations along with a delineation of key educational programming that helps youth reintegrate back into school and achieve academic success.",
