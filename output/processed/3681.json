    "Abstract": "Introduction The Peer Recovery Expansion Project (PREP) was designed to expand outreach and deliver enhanced treatment services via peer-recovery coaches for individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) and limited access to healthcare. Methods PREP was implemented in low-socioeconomic areas with historic challenges to accessing SUD treatment. Services were provided to 153 clients through tailored cultural responsiveness, use of peer-based recovery coaching, and development of a Recovery Support Network. Outcome data were collected using the Government Performance and Reporting Act tool at intake and at 6-month follow-up for coaches and clients. Results The vast majority of peer-recovery coaches were satisfied with the overall quality of the training and their training experience (96.8%). Around 95% agreed that the training enhanced their skills in the topic area and 93% agreed that the training was relevant to substance use disorder treatment at the 6-month post training survey. Majority of clients were from low-income, minority demographics that had a high prevalence history of incarceration, homelessness, and inconsistent employment. At 6-month follow-up, they reported a 22% increase in stable housing and a 25% increase in full-time/part-time employment/training program enrollment. They also demonstrated a significant decline in reported depression, anxiety, and prescribed medication use at 6-month follow-up when compared to baseline. Conclusions Clients enrolled in a tailored evidence based peer-led program decreased their psychiatric symptoms and increased their housing stability and employment. Study outcomes support the use of an integrated peer-led support for increasing engagement in care for adults experiencing substance use disorders.",
