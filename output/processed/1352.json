    "Article Title": "Factors associated with Quitline and pharmacotherapy utilisation among low-socioeconomic status smokers",
    "Abstract": "Aims: To examine factors associated with Quitline and pharmacotherapy utilisation in low socioeconomic status (low-SES) smokers enrolled in a smoking cessation trial.Methods: Baseline data was used from a large-scale smoking cessation randomised controlled trial (RCT). Logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of treatment utilisation prior to entering the RCT and perceived effectiveness of past and future use.Results: A total of 1047 smokers consented and prior to enrolment 92% had previously tried to quit smoking, 86% had ever used quit support, 83% had used pharmacotherapy at least once and 38% had ever utilised Quitline. For those who had used pharmacotherapies, 71% used NRT, of which 21% had used dual NRT products. In the last 12-months, 27% utilised Quitline and 50% utilised NRT. Ever use of Quitline was negatively associated with self-efficacy to quit (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.94 p < .01) and positively associated with being diagnosed with a mental health condition (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.25 p < .05). Recent use of NRT was positively associated with mental health condition (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.90 p < .05) and negatively associated with alcohol consumption (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.92 p < .01).Conclusion: Past use of Quitline and pharmacotherapy treatment was associated with self-efficacy to quit, sociodemographic variables, mental health conditions and alcohol consumption. Community-based strategies that target smoking, mental health and drug and alcohol problems may overcome some of the barriers that prevent low-SES populations from engaging with smoking cessation support.",
