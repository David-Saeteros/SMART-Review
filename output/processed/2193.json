    "Article Title": "Precariat women's experiences to undertake an entrepreneurial training program",
    "Abstract": "Women aged over 50 in Australia are becoming increasingly reliant on long-term welfare. Individual characteristics, societal norms, industry practices, and government policy create a multi-factorial, precariat population who have difficulties finding consistent, meaningful employment, live in financial distress, and have poor selfefficacy and mental health. Globally, entrepreneurial intervention programs are touted as an active labor market policy solution, helping people out of welfare into self-employment, and contributing to economic growth. While women and the long-term unemployed tend to struggle in such programs, in comparison, older participants thrive. The study aimed to identify the main factors that shape precariat women's experiences in undertaking entrepreneurial intervention programs. Interview data collected longitudinally from 39 precariat women revealed four salient themes: the need for achievement as a motivator; self-efficacy and confidence; the negative impact of losing welfare assistance; and the beneficial impact of education and upskilling training. We discuss implications for research and policy.",
