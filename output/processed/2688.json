    "Abstract": "Objective: In this study, we examined the pursuit of education and employment among participants in the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Connection Program (Dixon et al., 2015; Essock et al., 2015), a first-episode psychosis (FEP) treatment program emphasizing participation in school and work. Method: Data were collected between 2011 and 2013 from all 65 individuals in the RAISE Connection Program. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and multinomial logit random effects models were used to examine rates and predictors of work/school participation. Results: Most participants who eventually engaged in vocational activities did so within the first year of participation. Many engaged in both school and work. Those working (alone or with school) had better premorbid functioning and cognition and less severe concurrent symptoms. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: Participants in FEP programs emphasizing school and work can have high rates of vocational participation and early engagement, often simultaneously in work and school.",
