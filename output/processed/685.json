    "Abstract": "Background Notifications of work-related mental disorders (WRMDs) are increasing while little data are available on trends by industrial sector.Aims To assess WRMD notifications and trends from 2001 to 2011 by industrial sector using data collected by the French National Network for Occupational Disease Vigilance and Prevention (RNV3P) network.Methods We calculated standardized notification ratios (SNRs) per sector. To analyse trends over time, we used odds ratios, analysed by logistic regression, including time as a discrete variable or as a continuous variable.Results We found higher than expected WRMD notifications in manufacturing; paper and book (SNR = 2.16; 95% CI [1.88-2.48]), chemical and pharmaceutical (SNR = 1.79; 95% CI [1.58-2.03]), textile and clothing (SNR = 1.27; 95% CI [1.04-1.54]). In the trade sectors, retail (SNR = 1.60; 95% CI [152-1.68]), motor vehicle and cycle trade and repair (SNR = 1.19; 95% CI [1.05-1.34]). In the services sector personal (SNR = 2.09; 95% CI [1.83-2.38), information technology (SNR = 1.54; 95% CI [1.36-1.74]), financial and insurance (SNR = 1.42; 95% CI [1.31-1.53]), post and telecommunication (SNR = 1.44; 95% CI [1.30-1.60]), human health and social work (SNR = 1.29; 95% CI [1.24-1.34]). We found an increase in notifications in agriculture, post-telecommunication services and the human health; social work sectors and a decrease in chemical/pharmaceutical, metal, and paper and book manufacturing sectors ( P < 0.05).Conclusions These results reveal trends in notifications for WRMDs by industrial sector. This highlights the importance of monitoring trends in WRMDs in specific worker subsets, using specialized networks such as the RNV3P.",
