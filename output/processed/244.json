    "Article Title": "Good psychiatric management for borderline personality disorder: A qualitative study of its implementation in a supported employment team",
    "Abstract": "Introduction People with borderline personality disorder have difficulties with work. The Individual Placement and Support model has shown its worldwide effectiveness in terms of vocational rehabilitation for individuals with psychiatric disorders. However, only a few recent studies have explored its results for people with personality disorders, and the findings were mitigated. Additionally, Individual Placement and Support job coaches reported difficulties in supporting this population. An evidence-based psychotherapeutic method, also applicable in a case management context, called Good Psychiatric Management for borderline personality disorder, could potentially overcome these obstacles. This study aimed to evaluate the initial integration of Good Psychiatric Management in Individual Placement and Support practice.Methods Individual Placement and Support practitioners of Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, were trained in Good Psychiatric Management in January 2022. Five of them participated in a focus group to collect their impressions about the training, and six were interviewed 9 months later to assess the initial adoption of Good Psychiatric Management into their practice. Thematic analyses were conducted.Results Job coaches were positive about this new tool. All of them found it useful and beneficial both for them and their patients. They were able to follow the main Good Psychiatric Management principles in their practice However, the findings also suggested some additional improvements in the implementation process.Conclusions Integrating Good Psychiatric Management in Individual Placement and Support seems feasible, and the team who appreciated it adopted it. The method offers new perspectives in community support for people living with borderline personality disorder.",
