    "Abstract": "Purpose:This study examines global social networksincluding friendship, support, and acquaintance networksof lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) older adults. Design and Methods:Utilizing data from a large community-based study, we employ multiple regression analyses to examine correlates of social network size and diversity. Results:Controlling for background characteristics, network size was positively associated with being female, transgender identity, employment, higher income, having a partner or a child, identity disclosure to a neighbor, engagement in religious activities, and service use. Controlling in addition for network size, network diversity was positively associated with younger age, being female, transgender identity, identity disclosure to a friend, religious activity, and service use. Implications:According to social capital theory, social networks provide a vehicle for social resources that can be beneficial for successful aging and well-being. This study is a first step at understanding the correlates of social network size and diversity among LGBT older adults.",
