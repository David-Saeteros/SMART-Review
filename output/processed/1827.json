    "Abstract": "Background Variables traditionally reported to influence the prognosis of occupational hand eczema (OHE) are atopic dermatitis (AD) and contact sensitization. However, recent studies indicate that lifestyle factors may be of major importance. Objectives To identify factors influencing the prognosis in a cohort of patients with recognized OHE. Methods In this register-based cohort study, individuals with hand eczema recognized as occupational disease in the period January 2010-December 2011 were identified using files from Labor Market Insurance Denmark and included in the study. At baseline, information on sex, age, occupation, wet work, AD and contact sensitization was collected. In 2015 participants received a questionnaire with questions about lifestyle factors, current occupation and healing of OHE. Results In total, 2703 patients received the questionnaire; 1491 responded to the question about healing of OHE and were included in the study. Altogether, 19 center dot 3% of patients reported complete healing at follow-up. Current tobacco smoking and a high level of stress were factors inversely associated with healing of hand eczema (P < 0 center dot 001 and P = 0 center dot 030, respectively), while a high level of exercise was significantly related to healing of eczema (P = 0 center dot 011). Change of profession was a favourable prognostic factor, while age, sex, AD, contact sensitization and education did not significantly influence prognosis. Conclusions Traditionally important risk factors such as AD and contact sensitization had no marked influence on prognosis, while lifestyle factors were of major importance. Our findings indicate that risk factors may vary over time, allowing for new perspectives on prevention. What's already known about this topic?Occupational hand eczema has a relapsing course and a poor overall prognosis. Atopic dermatitis and contact sensitization have previously been reported as risk factors for a poor prognosis. What does this study add?The results indicate that lifestyle factors are of importance for the prognosis of occupational hand eczema. Traditionally reported risk factors such as atopic dermatitis and contact sensitization do not currently influence prognosis.",
