    "Article Title": "Socioeconomic status and sleep disturbances among pediatric population: a continental systematic review of empirical research",
    "Abstract": "To this day, no consensus has been established on the definition and the conceptualization of the socioeconomic status (SES), since all the available studies on the relation between SES and health did not use the same conceptual framework and operationalization to assess SES. While literature reported that SES markers (such as income, social support networks, education, employment or occupation) influence the health of populations by shaping living conditions; empirical research does not tell us which SES markers affect more strongly the sleep components of the individuals, as well as which sleep disorders (SD) are affected and how. Even though several original studies have tried to assess how changes in socioeconomic status of parents may affect the psychosocial environment and mental health of an individual directly or through his community, no systematic reviews on the influence of SES on children's sleep are available. This systematic review make an update on the different measures of SES and sleep disturbances used for pediatric population across the different regions of the world. Recommendations for a future standardization of SES measures is proposed, for a better understanding of its influence on sleep disturbances.",
