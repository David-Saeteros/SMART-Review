    "Abstract": "Objective: Information technology is opening up new ways to engage people who may benefit from psychiatric services. This study examined an intervention to promote engagement in supported employment for use with a tablet computer. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 45 clients at an urban community mental health agency received a software application for use with a computer tablet and a brochure to promote engagement with supported employment services (N=22) or only the brochure (N=23). Engagement was defined as requesting and attending an in-person meeting with an employment specialist within 30 days postintervention. Results: Engagement was reported for 11 (50%) participants who received the tablet-based application and one participant (4%) who received only the brochure (odds ratio=22.95, 95% confidence interval=2.51-193.38). Conclusions: Mobile computer based engagement interventions can promote initial contact between clients and employment specialists.",
