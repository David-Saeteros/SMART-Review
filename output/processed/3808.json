    "Abstract": "Purpose To elucidate the long-term impacts of hearing loss, tinnitus and balance in people living with and beyond cancer (LWBC) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (PBCT).Methods A literature search was conducted between March and June 2022 using PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Full-text papers in English were included. Articles explored the impacts of hearing loss, tinnitus and balance and discussed them in the context of treatment. If PBCT was used in conjunction with other treatments, the article was included. There were no constraints on age, cancer type, publication date, location, study design or data type. Sixteen studies and two reviews were included.Results Hearing loss and tinnitus can cause communication difficulties and subsequent social withdrawal. There were deficits in cognition, child development and educational performance. Employment and the ease of everyday life were disrupted by hearing loss and tinnitus, whereas poor balance interfered with walking and increased the risk of falls. Depression and anxiety were related to ototoxicity. Most notable were the differing mindsets experienced by adults LWBC with ototoxicity. There was evidence of inadequate monitoring of ototoxicity by clinicians and a lack of communication between clinicians and patients about ototoxicity as a side effect.Conclusions Ototoxicity has a negative long-term impact on multiple areas of life for adults and children LWBC. This can compromise their quality of life.Implications for cancer survivors Increased awareness, monitoring and education surrounding these issues may lead to earlier intervention and better management of ototoxicity, enhancing the quality of life of people LWBC.",
