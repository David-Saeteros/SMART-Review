    "Abstract": "Drawing on the Job Demand-Control-Support (JDCS) model framework, the present study tested thestrainand theiso-strainhypotheses. Specifically, the direct effect of job demands on depression, as well as the moderating role of job control, social support and their joint effect (job control x social support) on the job demand-depression link, was investigated. The data were collected from a representative sample of police officers. Job demands related to operational and organizational police stress were taken into account. Regression analysis using Hayes' PROCESS macros was applied. The results support thestrainhypothesis, and in part theiso-strainhypothesis of the JDCS model. Both operational and organizational demands were directly associated with depression. The strain hypothesis was confirmed in part. Social support and, to a partial extent, job control buffered the negative effects of job demands on depression. Three-way interactional effect was supported but only with respect to organizational (and not operational) demands. High social support intensifies the buffering effect of job control on the organizational demands-depression link. The results partially support the notion of the JDCS model and provide further insight into processes leading to ill health among police officers in the workplace.",
