    "Article Title": "Impact of Psoriasis Therapy on Comorbid Conditions",
    "Abstract": "Several conditions have been associated with psoriasis, including chronic kidney disease, Crohn's disease, depression, and cardiovascular disease. Psoriasis also negatively impacts patients' economic health in terms of employment and work productivity. Clinicians should be aware of these potential comorbidities and consider them when monitoring patients and choosing psoriasis therapy. Recent studies have evaluated if treating psoriasis can alleviate these comorbidities. (C) 2015 published by Frontline Medical Communications",
