    "Article Title": "Supports for Postsecondary Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review",
    "Abstract": "In order to survey extant literature examining support specifically for postsecondary students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a systematic review of the literature was conducted through a synthesis of an established protocol of quality indicators for special education research and the methodology for PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses). Eight themes were identified describing features of programs, interventions, and supports that were implemented or described in the 21 studies reviewed. One of the themes, parent support, is underexamined in the literature relating to postsecondary institutions. Recommendations for needed research are included.",
