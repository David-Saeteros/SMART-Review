    "Article Title": "Application of mindfulness-based stress reduction to a stress management intervention in a study of a mining sector company",
    "Abstract": "Purpose. The aim of this article was to check whether mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an effective intervention in reducing work-related stress in the case of workers in a copper mine. Methods. Sixty six employees were randomized to the experimental group (32 participants) or to the control group (34 participants). Work-related stress was measured using the job content questionnaire (JCQ) and mental health was measured using the general health questionnaire (GHQ-28) Experimental manipulation was 40-h MBSR training. Results. Multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant increase of JCQ decision latitude (F=17.36, p<0.001) and social support (supervisor F=9.00, p<0.004; coworker F=5.61, p<0.020), and a significant decrease in GHQ-28 anxiety (F=5.28, p<0.079) and depression (F=3.95, p<0.048) due to the intervention. Conclusions. The study confirms that MBSR can be effective in reducing stress resulting from the external risk (and/or imagined fear) of losing one's health or life. The use of MBSR could be recommended in health and safety activities in difficult and dangerous work conditions, such as mining, to promote workers' well-being.",
