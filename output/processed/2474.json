    "Abstract": "Background: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are the most impairing psychiatric disorders and are a major cause of social exclusion. Despite that, there are only two studies published assessing the socioeconomic characteristics of SSD patients living in Portugal. Aims: The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of social and family support for SSD patients living in the region of 'Tamega e Sousa', in northern Portugal. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using patients under home-based care provided by the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Centro Hospitalar do Tamega e Sousa. We retrieved sociodemographic data from clinical records. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee. Results: Our sample consists on 67 patients with SSD, mostly men (74.6%). Although the majority was single (69.2%) and childless (85.7%), only a minority lived alone (21.2%). In relation to their professional status, only 5.0% were employed and 78.3% got a disability pension. Among the patients that lived accompanied, 68% lived with their parents or grandparents, and a quarter lived with family members affected by psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: These findings highlight the dependence of SSD patients on their family's support. Lack of labour market integration, economic dependence and difficulty establishing stable relationships further aggravate their social exclusion. Although our results are consistent with a previous observational study held in Portugal, our patients display a worse functional status. Even considering the possible patient selection bias, there is evidence supporting the need for more investment in psychosocial rehabilitation that should take into account the sociodemographic idiosyncrasies of this Portuguese region.",
