    "Abstract": "Objectives There are health disparities and inequities in the outcomes of critical illness survivors related to the influence of social determinants of health on recovery. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between critical illness recovery and the intermediary social determinants of health in the Canadian context. Because Canadian healthcare is provided within a universal publicly funded system, this analysis sheds light on the role of social determinants of health in the context of universal health services and a relatively robust social safety net. Design In this qualitative interpretive description study, data from semi-structured interviews with intensive care unit survivors, family caregivers and healthcare providers were analysed using thematic and constant comparative methods. Setting Western Canadian Hospital serving a population of 900 000 people. Participants The 74 study participants included 30 patients (mean age 58 years, 18 men and 12 women) and 25 family caregivers (mean age 55 years, 8 men and 17 women), representing 37 cases, as well as 19 healthcare providers. Results Challenges with employment and finances, home set-up, transportation, food and nutrition, medications and social support complicated and hindered critical illness recovery. Critical illness sequelae also altered these social determinants of health, suggesting a reciprocal relationship. Furthermore, individuals experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage before critical illness described being at a greater disadvantage following their critical illness, which interfered with their recovery and suggests an accumulation of risk for some. Conclusions Our findings underscore the significant influence of social determinants of health on critical illness recovery, highlighting the importance of creating and evaluating comprehensive approaches to health and well-being that address health inequities.",
