    "Article Title": "Ten Modifiable Health Risk Factors and Employees' Medical Costs-An Update",
    "Abstract": "Purpose:To estimate the relationship between employees' health risks and health-care costs to inform health promotion program design.Design:An observational study of person-level health-care claims and health risk assessment (HRA) data that used regression models to estimate the relationship between 10 modifiable risk factors and subsequent year 1 health-care costs.Setting:United States.Participants:The sample included active, full-time, adult employees continuously enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance plans contributing to IBM MarketScan Research Databases who completed an HRA. Study criteria were met by 135 219 employees from 11 employers.Measures:Ten modifiable risk factors and individual sociodemographic and health characteristics were included in the models as independent variables. Five settings of health-care costs were outcomes in addition to total expenditures.Analysis:After building the analytic file, we estimated generalized linear models and conducted postestimation bootstrapping.Results:Health-care costs were significantly higher for employees at higher risk for blood glucose, obesity, stress, depression, and physical inactivity (all at P < .0001) than for those at lower risk. Similar cost differentials were found when specific health-care services were examined.Conclusion:Employers may achieve cost savings in the short run by implementing comprehensive health promotion programs that focus on decreasing multiple health risks.",
