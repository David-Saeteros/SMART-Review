    "Article Title": "Intimate partner aggression and work: An interdisciplinary review and agenda for future research",
    "Abstract": "Intimate partner aggression (IPA) is a social issue that affects the workplace. While IPA has been relatively ignored by management scholars due to notions that it is a private domestic matter, recent research offers mounting evidence of its spillover effects at work, including consequences for victims, perpetrators, coworkers, and organizations. To date, scholarly research on IPA and work has been impeded because existing research is scattered across disciplines with differing conceptualizations and emphasis. This integrative review aims to clarify the constructs of IPA and work-related IPA (WIPA), summarize existing IPA and work research, integrate prior studies to offer a nomological network of antecedents and consequences of IPA victimization and perpetration, and propose specific recommendations that can further stimulate scholarly attention on this important research area.",
