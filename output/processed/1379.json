    "Article Title": "Using visual processing training to enhance standard cognitive remediation outcomes in schizophrenia: A pilot study",
    "Abstract": "Approaches to cognitive remediation (CR) that address sensory perceptual skills before higher cognitive skills, have been found to be effective in enhancing cognitive performance in schizophrenia. To date, however, most of the conducted trials have concentrated on auditory processing. The aim of this study was to explore whether the addition of visual processing training could enhance standard cognitive remediation outcomes in a schizo. phrenia population. Twenty participants were randomised to either receive 20 h of computer-assisted cognitive remediation alone or 20 h of visual processing training modules and cognitive remediation training. All participants were assessed at baseline and at the end of cognitive remediation training on cognitive and psychosocial (i.e. self-esteem, quality of life) measures. At the end of the study participants across both groups improved significantly in overall cognition and psychosocial functioning. No significant differences were observed between groups on any of the measures. Of potential interest, however, was that the Cohen's d assessing the between group difference in the rates of change were moderate/large for a greater improvement in Visual Learning, Working Memory and Social Cognition for the visual training plus cognitive remediation group. On the basis of our effect sizes on three domains of cognition, we recommend replicating this intervention with a larger sample.",
