    "Abstract": "BackgroundThe incidence of sickness absence (SA) due to common mental disorders (CMDs) has increased in recent decades. It is hence important to elucidate how individuals with CMDs can maintain work. The aim was to analyse the relationship between psychosocial and organisational workplace factors and a spell of > 14 days of SA among persons with CMDs.MethodsIncluded were respondents of the Swedish Work Environment Survey (SWES) 1993-2013, diagnosed with a CMD up to five years before the interview in the SWES (n = 3,795). Relative Risk (RR) regression models with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) analysed associations between psychosocial-, and organisational workplace factors and a subsequent spell of SA > 14 days.ResultsLow control over work (RR:1.16; CI:1.01-1.35), job strain (RR:1.25; CI:1.04-1.49), no flexible working hours (RR:1.25; CI:1.08-1.45) or no possibility to work from home (RR:1.37; CI:1.13-1.66) were significantly related to an increased risk of SA. Persons diagnosed with depression experiencing job strain had the highest increased risk of SA (RR:1.55; CI: 1.07-2.25).ConclusionsA sustainable work-life among working individuals with CMDs can be provided by reducing job strain, and if possible, by increasing flexibility regarding workplace and working hours. This may prevent spells of SA, and hereby increase productivity.",
