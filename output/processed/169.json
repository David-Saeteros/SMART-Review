    "Article Title": "Protocol of health screening related to occupational diseases in 100 000 workers in critical sectors: a cross-sectional study with worksite risk assessment",
    "Abstract": "Background Occupational diseases are one of the most important health problems related to employment However, in Malaysia, there are few epidemiological studies discussing these issues, especially among workers in the industry. For that, this study aimed to screen workers from high-risk industrial sectors, identify hazards in the workplace and recommend improvement measures in the workplace to prevent occupational diseases. Methods and analysis This is a 3-year project in which a survey of 100 000 workers from all 13 states in Malaysia will be conducted using a web-based screening tool that is comprised of two parts: occupational disease screening tool and hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control method. Data will be collected using a multistage stratified sampling method from 500 companies, including seven critical industrial sectors. The independent variables will be sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, previous medical history, high-risk behaviour and workplace profile. The dependent variable will be the types of occupational diseases (noise-induced hearing loss, respiratory, musculoskeletal, neurotoxic, skin and mental disorders). Subsequently, suggestions of referral for medium and high-risk workers to occupational health clinics will be attained. The approved occupational health service clinics/providers will make a confirmatory diagnosis of each case as deemed necessary. Subsequently, a walk-through survey to identify workplace hazards and recommend workplace improvement measures to prevent these occupational diseases will be achieved. Both descriptive and inferential statistics will be used in this study. Simple and adjusted binary regression will be used to find the determinants of occupational diseases. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the MARA University of Technology Research Ethics Board. Informed, written consent will be obtained from all study participants. Findings will be disseminated to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety, involved industries, and through peer-reviewed publications.",
