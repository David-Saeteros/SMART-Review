    "Abstract": "Positivity construct refers to the propensity to think positively about oneself, life and the future, being closely related to wellbeing and health. Moreover, coping strategies used to manage stress have an important role in the development of mental health problems, one of which is adjustment disorder (AD).The aim of this study was: Firstly, to analyze the differences in positivity, coping, and some relevant socio-demographic variables between the clinical (formed by patients with AD; N=57) and the control (N=66) groups; and secondly, to analyze whether these variables could predict, using binary logistic regression, the participants' membership to the clinical or the control group.The clinical group showed less positivity and a greater use of disengagement strategies compared to the control group. Furthermore, the variables assessed were able to predict the clinical or control group membership with a 91% of success rate. The main risk factors to belong to the clinical group were the use of social support coping and disengagement strategies; whereas active employment status, the use of humor, positivity and younger age decreased this risk.",
