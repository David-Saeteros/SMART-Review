    "Article Title": "Social Support Received and Provided in the Adjustment of Parents of Children With Cancer",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of the present study is to determine the relation between the satisfaction of parents of children with cancer with the social support received and provided from a multidimensional perspective (sources and types of support) and the disruptions that take place in different areas of their lives (partner, children, family, social relations, and economic and employment situation) Method: One hundred twelve parents of children diagnosed with cancer who received treatment at the Mother and Child Hospital of Malaga (Spain) were recruited. Data were gathered through self-reporting measures. The instrument used includes a questionnaire about socio-demographic variables, a questionnaire about parents' adjustment to the situation and a questionnaire about social support received and provided based on the different sources and types of support. Results: There is a negative and significant relation between satisfaction with support received and provided and the magnitude of disruptions in parents' lives. Conclusion: Satisfaction with emotional support received from the partner and family, and support provided to these sources, relate to lower disruption in different areas of parents' lives. These results can have significant practical implications for the psychosocial care provided to parents of children with cancer.",
