    "Abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the current provision and policy focus on Individual Placement and Support (IPS) in England. Method: This report reviews current and future national developments shaping the future direction of IPS in England. Results: Recent government policy announcements have led to an increased interest and focus on IPS nationally throughout England, leading to an expected growth in the numbers of people with a serious mental illness able to access employment support. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: England has the potential to become an exemplar of the supported employment approach and helping people with mental health problems get back to work, allowing individuals the opportunity to recover and access the benefits that employment can bring.",
