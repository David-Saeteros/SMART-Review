    "Article Title": "A reliable and valid questionnaire was developed to measure computer vision syndrome at the workplace",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: To design and validate a questionnaire to measure visual symptoms related to exposure to computers in the workplace.Study Design and Setting: Our computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) was based on a literature review and validated through discussion with experts and performance of a pretest, pilot test, and retest. Content validity was evaluated by occupational health, optometry, and ophthalmology experts. Rasch analysis was used in the psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire. Criterion validity was determined by calculating the sensitivity and specificity, receiver operator characteristic curve, and cutoff point. Test retest repeatability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance by Cohen's kappa (kappa).Results: The CVS-Q was developed with wide consensus among experts and was well accepted by the target group. It assesses the frequency and intensity of 16 symptoms using a single rating scale (symptom severity) that fits the Rasch rating scale model well. The questionnaire has sensitivity and specificity over 70% and achieved good test retest repeatability both for the scores obtained [ICC = 0.802; 95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.673, 0.8841 and CVS classification (kappa = 0.612; 95% CI: 0.384, 0.839).Conclusion: The CVS-Q has acceptable psychometric properties, making it a valid and reliable tool to control the visual health of computer workers, and can potentially be used in clinical trials and outcome research.
