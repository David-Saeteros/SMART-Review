    "Abstract": "Background Climate change can negatively affect mental health, and poor mental health can negatively affect work. However, less is known about the relationship between mental health and workplace behaviours within the climate change context. Aims To explore existing literature relating to climate-induced mental ill-health as a potential predictor of workplace behaviours. Methods Scoping review, searching five databases for relevant literature using two separate search strategies. Results Only five studies with any relevant data were found. Results could not be easily synthesized because each of the five considered different work-related outcomes. However, the available data suggest that the psychological impact of extreme events could lead to increased job tension, higher turnover intentions and workplace hostility. Stress about extreme weather could also impede the ability to make essential work-related decisions and, for those who work in the environmental sector, concerns about climate could lead to overcommitment to work. There was some evidence that social support might lessen the effects of climate-induced stress on work outcomes. Conclusions Very little literature considers the impacts of climate change on employees' mental health and associated workplace function. The available evidence suggests there are potential negative impacts which may be mitigated by social support. It is important for future research to explore ways of supporting staff and fostering resilience.Despite recent academic interest in how climate change can affect mental health and how mental health can affect workplace behaviours, the three topics are rarely considered together. Little is known about how the effects of climate change on workers' mental health might subsequently impact workplace function. This scoping review found very few studies considering 'climate-induced mental ill-health' as a potential predictor of work outcomes and calls for more research to fill this gap in understanding.",
