    "Abstract": "The integration of highly skilled immigrants into the Canadian labor market is a complex endeavor, fraught with challenges that necessitate the adoption of various resilience strategies. This study delves into the impact of resilience on the well-being of highly skilled African immigrants (HSAI) navigating the Quebec labor market. This research draws on Ungar's (2012) ecological perspective of resilience and Siegelman's well-being theory to provide an explanation about the impact of HSAIs' resilience on their well-being. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 16 HSAI participants (9 Anglophone and 7 Francophone HSAIs), the research unveils the nuanced dynamics of resilience and well-being during the labor market integration (LMI) process. While personal resilience is evident in educational pursuits and workplace adaptation, a crucial revelation emerges-the toll these adaptive strategies take on HSAIs' wellbeing. The findings underscore the need for targeted policies aimed at supporting the well-being of highly skilled African immigrants during the labor market integration process. Enhancing awareness and accessibility of tailored mental health resources is crucial. Integrating these considerations into policy frameworks can create a more supportive process for highly skilled African immigrants in Quebec.",
