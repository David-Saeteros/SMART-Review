    "Abstract": "The Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) is a 34 sites randomized controlled trial conducted in the US and evaluating the benefits of a multi-component pharmacological and psychosocial intervention called NAVIGATE in comparison to usual care for the treatment of first-episode psychosis patients. The background, rationale and design of the study are reviewed as well as the conceptual foundation of the NAVIGATE program. We also give details on the core interventions provided in NAVIGATE that include individualized medication management, family education, individual resiliency training, and supported education and employment. Finally we summarize preliminary findings from the baseline cohort on duration of untreated psychosis, prescription practices, and cardiometabolic risk. Data about efficiency of NAVIGATE have just been published. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2016",
