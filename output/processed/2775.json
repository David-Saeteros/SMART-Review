    "Article Title": "Can an Internal Locus of Control and Social Support Reduce Work-Related Levels of Stress and Strain? A Comparative Study Between Spanish Owners and Managers",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this article is to assess the role played by both individual and contextual factors in reducing the manager's levels of stress and strain within the workplace setting. This article also highlights the manager's locus of control (LOC) as an internal factor and emphasizes the social support variable as a contextual factor. Methods: We use a sample of 332 respondents belonging to Spanish manufacturing and services firms and a structural equation modeling technique (partial least squares path modeling). Results: The results reveal that there are significant differences between managers and owners about stress-strain relationship. Conclusions: The study provides support for the literature on stress management, which emphasizes the importance of a LOC and social support in influencing stress and strain between managers and owners.",
