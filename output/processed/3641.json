    "Article Title": "Psychosocial impacts of adult strabismus and strabismus surgery: a review of the literature",
    "Abstract": "Background: Patients with strabismus may suffer from both reduced visual functioning and the psychosocial effects of ocular misalignment. For adults with strabismus, there is a strong body of evidence supporting the advantages of surgical restoration of binocular visual function. However, even in the absence of binocular visual potential, patients may benefit from reconstructive surgery to restore an aesthetically acceptable ocular alignment.Objective: To review the psychosocial implications of strabismus in the adult population and to summarize the psychosocial impact of surgical correction.Methods: A Medline search (1946-2013) was conducted to identify the psychosocial implications of strabismus, its effects on employment, and the impact of surgical correction on strabismic adults using the following keywords: strabismus, surgery, quality of life, life style, employment/employability effects, job satisfaction, social support/social isolation/social marginalization, adaptation, stress, depression, family relations, interpersonal relations, friends, and peer group. The search was limited to patients older than 18 years and studies published in English. Of the initial 87 articles for which abstracts were reviewed, 20 studies were of sufficient relevance to be included in the review.Results: Eight studies examined the psychosocial impact of strabismus, 2 of which explored the effect of strabismus on finding partners, and 4 studies examined the effect of strabismus on employment. These studies examined perceptions of both patients with strabismus and the general population. Eight studies evaluated the impact of strabismus surgery. Strabismus was shown to have negative psychosocial functioning and employability in both patients' and the public's perceptions. Surgical correction was associated with long-lasting improvement in psychological and social functioning.Conclusions: There is a fairly strong body of evidence in the literature to suggest that adult strabismus patients suffer significant social, psychological, and economic effects because of their condition. Surgery can be effective in improving these disadvantages. Clinicians should be aware of the importance of offering surgery to patients with significant strabismus, even in patients for whom it is not expected to improve visual function.",
