    "Abstract": "Objective: To examine whether motivational interviewing (MI) leads to more sustainable return-to-work outcomes for injured workers undergoing rehabilitation.Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial.Setting: Workers' compensation rehabilitation facility.Participants: Claimants (N=728) undergoing rehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions, who were predominantly employed (529, 72.7%) men (460, 63.2%) with chronic conditions (mean duration, 234d).Interventions: MI is a goal-oriented, client-centered counseling approach that facilitates behavioral change through identifying and resolving ambivalence. Treating clinicians at the facility were randomized into 2 groups. One group included 6 clinicians who were trained to conduct MI interventions during rehabilitation, while the control group included 6 clinicians who continued standard procedures.Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes included compensation outcomes over 1 year after discharge. This included reception of disability benefits and recurrence rates. Analysis was stratified by admission employment status and included chi-square test, t test, and multivariable regression.Results: Participants included 728 claimants, of whom 367 (50.4%) were treated with MI. Unemployed claimants in the MI group received significantly more partial temporary disability benefits (mean, 8.2d vs 0.2d; P=.02), indicating return to modified work duties. Employed claimants in the control group had a higher recurrence rate (9.1% vs 4.5%; P=.04). The adjusted odds ratio for benefit recurrence was 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.5) after controlling for age, sex, and number of previous claims.Conclusions: Use of MI appears to lead to more sustainable return to work after rehabilitation and facilitates transition to modified work duties.
