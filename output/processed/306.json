    "Article Title": "The Approach Taken to Substance Abuse by Occupational Physicians A Qualitative Study on Influencing Factors",
    "Abstract": "Objective: Aiming to enhance occupational physicians' (OPs) practice when dealing with employee substance abuse, this study analyzes the experiences of OPs to gain insight into the factors influencing their behavior. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: OPs act differently depending on the type of drug. Their approach was mainly determined by contextual factors and by their attitudes and skills. Many OPs want to invest in health promotion. Barriers such as lack of time and focus on periodic examinations often hamper both adequate prevention and the management of workers with substance abuse. Conclusions: The approach to substance abuse by OPs could be supported by initiatives both at the individual and the collective level. A facilitating work context seems to be particularly important in their commitment to alcohol-and drug-related issues at work.",
