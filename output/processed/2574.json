    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Employment rates for people with HIV/AIDS are low, compared to the general population. One widespread barrier is fatigue, accompanied by daytime sleepiness and a lack of stamina. Previous pharmacological studies have demonstrated improvement of fatigue-related symptoms without affecting work-related goal attainmentOBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we sought to determine whether a pharmacologic-behavioral two-phase combined approach could facilitate returning to work.METHODS: HIV+ participants with fatigue were treated with armodafinil. If energy improved, 8 sessions of biweekly manualized Behavioral Activation (BA) counseling were added to medication maintenance. Outcome was assessed on a 3-point scale along with clinician and self-ratings.RESULTS: Of the 46 participants enrolled in BA, 15 (33%) did not complete all 8 sessions: 6 got jobs so they no longer needed counseling; 4 did not like BA, and 5 dropped out for reasons such as moving away or substance use relapse. Of the 46, 29 (63%) attained their vocational goal and showed significant changes on self-report scales.CONCLUSIONS: Our integrated treatment including armodafinil plus BA counseling significantly increased the success of achieving work-related goals. The two-phase medication plus counseling program was well-tolerated by participants and the manualized BA counseling was readily applied by counselors without advanced mental health training, making the method potentially feasible in community settings.",
