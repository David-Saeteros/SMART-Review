    "Abstract": "Impact and Implications Individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI) and co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have high rates of unemployment. This study investigates the ways PTSD interferes with employment among persons with SMI. Findings illustrate several ways on how trauma can affect career development for persons with SMI. Addressing trauma symptoms as a key barrier to career development and employment for clients with SMI receiving employment services is crucial to ensure successful outcomes.Objective: There is evidence that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a hidden barrier to employment among individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI) among whom PTSD is highly prevalent. This study aimed to explore how PTSD interferes with achieving employment outcomes among persons with SMI. Methods: Participants included 119 individuals with SMI and co-occurring PTSD receiving Supported Employment services. Responses to the question, In what ways are PTSD symptoms interfering with your work during the past month? were analyzed. Results: Six themes emerged: (a) I don't like being around people, (b) I feel frozen and unable to get started, (c) troubling negative affect, (d) mind is scattered and all over the place, (e) feeling fatigued all the time, and (f) flashbacks and triggers can happen whenever. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Findings provide insight into how PTSD symptoms impact work outcomes and suggest that there is a need for Supported Employment providers to screen clients for trauma exposure to identify those in need of additional support in order to improve work outcomes.",
