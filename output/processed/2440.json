    "Abstract": "This column focuses on use of learning collaboratives by the Center for Practice Innovations to help programs implement the evidence-based individual placement and support model of supported employment in New York State. These learning collaboratives use fidelity and performance indicator data to drive the development of program-specific individualized quality improvement plans. As of 2014, 59 ( 69%) of 86 eligible programs have joined the initiative. Programs are achieving employment outcomes for consumers on par with national benchmarks, along with improved fidelity.",
