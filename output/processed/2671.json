    "Article Title": "LGBTQ+ Structural Stigma and College Counseling Center Website Friendliness",
    "Abstract": "We examined whether the friendliness of college counseling center websites to students with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer, plus other identities (LGBTQ+) varied by state-level structural policies on hate crime, employment nondiscrimination, and religious exemption. Results from our analyses of variance showed that website friendliness was significantly higher in states that offered hate-crime and employment nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ+ individuals. Our findings highlight the need to intervene at multiple ecological levels to build inclusive college communities.",
