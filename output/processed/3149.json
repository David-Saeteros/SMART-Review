    "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to explore the link between sexual harassment at work and mental health. Eight hundred and one women (n = 801; Mage = 40.88 years, SD 11.62, range = 18-80; 91.88% were professionally active) completed several questionnaires online concerning sexual harassment at work, psychological symptoms, and substance use habits. The results of a Mann-Whitney mean comparison showed that participants who had experienced sexual harassment at work (n = 175) were more likely to report depressive symptoms, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and burnout, than those who had not (n = 676). They were also less likely to be satisfied with the perceived social support they received. However, consumption of alcohol and cannabis, as a coping mechanism, was not implicated in sexual cases. Sexual harassment at work is associated with important psychological issues. If the association is indicative of a causal link, then providing support in developing self-esteem to people who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace may help in the resilience and recovery process.",
