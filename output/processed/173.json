    "Abstract": "Individuals with psychosocial disabilities face substantial barriers that hinder their equal participation in working life, such as discrimination and lack of self-determination. A method developed to increase work integration and self-determination for persons experiencing mental illness is Individual Placement and Support (IPS), which embraces the zero-exclusion principle. This entails that service users themselves should decide when they want to engage in work (re-)integration and that professionals should not, based on their professional assessments, exclude anyone. The study reveals that managers in healthcare and employment services experience practitioners' adherence to a professionalism logic, which hinders self-determination because professionals make pre-assessments to determine who is job ready. However, managers made use of the zero-exclusion principle to promote self-determination and challenge the dominant professionalism logic. Additionally, findings indicate that managers observed a gradual shift in perceptions about job readiness and referrals to IPS over time as practitioners gained experience with the zero-exclusion principle.",
