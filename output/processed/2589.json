    "Article Title": "Evidence-based policy strategies: A typology",
    "Abstract": "Evidence-based policymaking is defined as using the best available research to inform policy, budget, and management decisions. In mental health, evidence-based policy focuses mainly on strategies aimed at promoting evidence-based programs. Policy strategies refer to actions either to formulate policy content or to promote program implementation. As a first step toward developing a systematic taxonomy, this article identifies seven policy strategies and illustrates them with case examples drawn from the mental health literature. Articulating discrete policy strategies may clarify components of a framework for a large-scale study of factors influencing the effectiveness of policies aimed at promoting evidence-based programs.",
