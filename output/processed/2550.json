    "Abstract": "This study aimed to understand school mental health providers' experiences with racism and other forms of discrimination (i.e., gendered-based discrimination) at work, with an exclusive focus on early career Black women. Participants included 10 Black women in school-based mental health fields, namely school psychology and school counseling. All participants completed one individual interview and data analysis was grounded in a transcendental phenomenological approach. Findings revealed three key themes: (1) Affinity and Action, (2) Individual Experience of Discrimination, and (3) Systemic Racism and Discrimination Impacting Students of Color. Participants were passionate about advocating for all students and liberating marginalized students from oppressive school structures. However, participants' own experiences with discrimination impacted their well-being and job satisfaction. The participating women utilized several strategies to cope and push for change (e.g., reporting to the human resource personnel). Yet, people in power precluded their efforts and the emotional toll led some participants to question whether they should transition to a new field of practice. Findings from this research support calls for increased attention to Black women in school mental health fields, because they are placed at risk of experiencing work discrimination due to their intersectional identities.",
