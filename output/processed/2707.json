    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts an individual's workforce involvement post-injury. Support services andworkplace accommodations that can help withwork re-integration post-TBI may differ based on a person's sex and gender. The added impact of COVID-19 remains under-explored.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the support services and workplace accommodation needs and the impact of COVID19 on work and mental health for persons with TBI, considering sex and gender.METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed. Descriptive and regression analyses were applied to uncover sex and gender differences, along with content analysis for open-ended responses.RESULTS: Thirty-two persons with TBI (62% women, 38% men) participated. Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and counselling services were indicated as the most needed services by women and men. Modified hours/days and modified/different duties were the most needed workplace accommodations. Mental challenges impacting well-being was a highlighted concern for both men and women. Women scored poorer on the daily activity domain of the Quality of Life after Brain Injury - Overall Scale (p = 0.02). Assistance with daily activities was highlighted by women for a successful transition to work, including housekeeping and caregiving. Men were more likely than women to experience change in employment status because of COVID-19 (p = 0.02). Further, a higher percentage of men expressed concern about the inability to pay for living accommodations, losing their job, and not having future job prospects.CONCLUSION: Findings reveal important differences between men and women when transitioning to work post-TBI and emphasize the need for sex and gender considerations.",
