    "Abstract": "Background: There are strong links between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic disease, mental health, job performance, and motor vehicle accidents. Corporate wellness clinics and health monitoring programs present ideal settings to educate and screen employees for OSA. Methods: In January 2020, the Stop-Bang Sleep Apnea Questionnaire was added to the yearly health monitoring program of 571 State of Texas air, water, and hazardous waste workers as part of routine care. Medium- and high-risk (HR) scoring employees were counseled to seek follow-up care from a primary-care provider (PCP). The January 2021 exams provided an opportunity to determine the success of counseling efforts. Findings: Of the 479 returning employees in 2021, 24 (49%) of HR and 17 (21.8%) of intermediate risk (IR) had discussed OSA with a PCP. Seven (14.3%) HR and 1 (<1%) IR employee underwent a sleep study and 4 (8.2%) were prescribed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Conclusions/Application to Practice: Screening for OSA at the workplace was inexpensive and, when diagnosed and treated, can mitigate associated chronic disease, improve worker productivity, and reduce associated accidents and injuries. The described OSA screening delivered value to the employer and employees. The screening was performed at a very low cost, involved little time on the part of the nurse practitioner and employees, brought signs and symptoms of OSA to the consciousness level of 571 employees, encouraged at-risk participants to discuss OSA with a PCP and led to 4 (8.2%) being prescribed CPAP.",
