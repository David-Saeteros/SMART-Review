    "Abstract": "Caregivers often prioritize the needs of the care recipient and neglect their own health needs. It is imperative to understand the factors related to their self-care practices and engagement in self-care activities. The present study examined the extent to which dementia caregivers engaged in self-care activities, how this varied depending on caregiver characteristics, and whether self-care engagement mediated the relationship between social support and caregiver outcomes. The study utilized baseline data from a diverse sample of dementia caregivers (N = 243) who participated in a randomized trial evaluating a psychosocial technology-based caregiver intervention. Results showed that the dementia caregivers engaged in low levels of self-care activities and that their engagement varied based on the caregivers' background characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, relationship to the care recipient, and employment status). Less caregiver involvement (e.g., less ADL/IADL help provided and more caregiver preparedness) and more social support predicted higher self-care activity engagement. Self-care activity engagement served as a mediator, such that more social support predicted more self-care activities, which, in turn, were associated with more positive perceptions of caregiving and less caregiver burden and depression. The findings suggest a need for interventions that promote self-care engagement among dementia caregivers and underscore the importance of social support and caregiver preparedness to caregivers' well-being.",
