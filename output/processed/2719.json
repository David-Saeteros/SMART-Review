    "Abstract": "Objectives To validate the factor structure of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) in a North American population and dissect the associations between psychosocial factors and workplace psychological health and safety. Methods Confirmatory factor analysis and multivariate linear regression were used to determine the associations between COPSOQ dimensions and a global rating of workplace psychological health and safety. Models were stratified by sex, gender roles, and age. Results The COPSOQ factor structure was verified among Canadian workers. Three factors were found to significantly contribute to the global rating of the psychological health and safety for all workers. Few differences were observed across sex, gender roles, and age. Conclusions This study identified dimensions of the psychosocial work environment that are strongly associated with the global rating of workplace psychological health and safety. Using a standardized questionnaire like the COPSOQ allows for comparisons over time, between different industries, and worker populations.",
