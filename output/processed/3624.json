    "Abstract": "The lack of studies on LGBTQIA+ people in leadership positions constitutes an investigative gap, which seems contradictory given that 7-15% of the population identifies with part of this community. The present study aimed to describe and explore the narratives of sexual minorities in leadership positions in Brazil and Portugal by comparing the two contexts and analyzing the psychological implications and well-being of this notably underrepresented population. To achieve that, a qualitative study was developed through an electronic interview, from which we obtained 45 participants, from which it was possible to identify 11 regular themes (LGBTQIA+ negativity, Health Impacts, LGBTQIA+ Identity, Impact of LGBTQIA+ identity on leadership, Intersectionality, Organizational Climate, Professional development, Personal characteristics, Social support, Coping strategies and Inspirational leadership). LGBTQIA+ negativity emerged as the most frequently mentioned theme. The results show that people still use avoidance mechanisms or counterfeit their LGBTQIA+ identity at work, while there are people who choose to have their LGBTQIA+ identity visible and use this as a tool to break heterosexist patterns, promoting equality and respect in the organizational environment through a queer leadership. It was possible to analyze the practices of leaders through the lens of queer theory, and we were able to observe that sexual minorities in Portugal and Brazil are united not only by language but also by similar experiences marked by discrimination and challenges, generating a major psychological impact. Despite these difficulties, these leaders tend to use their personal principles, showing characteristics of authentic leadership.",
