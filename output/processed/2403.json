    "Article Title": "Managing absence and dropout in vocational rehabilitation - a mixed-methods analysis of practices and perspectives among vocational rehabilitation companies in Norway",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: While absence and dropout represent challenges to the implementation of vocational rehabilitation programs in Norway, sanctions are rarely used in practice. The purpose of the article was to investigate the extent to which vocational rehabilitation managers and professionals experience that the absence regulations support a viable implementation of vocational rehabilitation programs. Methods: An open-ended question, asking vocational rehabilitation managers about their experiences in handling absence, was presented as part of an electronic questionnaire sent to all vocational rehabilitation companies in Norway. 72 managers (59%) responded to the open-ended question, and a qualitative content analysis was conducted. Insight from ten focus group interviews were included as part of the analyses. Results: Five thematic categories were created, which in their various ways demonstrate challenges associated with absence management in vocational rehabilitation programs: (i) failure of the Labour and welfare administration to react against unfounded absence; (ii) difficulties in distinguishing valid from nonvalid absence; (iii) uncertainty concerning the role of the general practitioner and medical documentation in the rehabilitation process; (iv) the prevalence of diffuse disorders and symptoms, and (v) lack of incentives and motivation among participants. Conclusions: Sound absence management requires a clarification of the role of the general practitioner in the vocational rehabilitation process and closer cooperation between general practitioners and vocational rehabilitation companies, to reduce unnecessary breaks in the process due to hasty issuing of sicknotes. Further, as absence management appears to be most difficult in relation to those with mental and social problems, a comprehensive view on disability and follow-up is needed, where physical, mental, social and contextual factors are seen together.",
