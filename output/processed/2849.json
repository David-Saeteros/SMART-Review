    "Article Title": "Disclosure and concealment of stigmatized identities",
    "Abstract": "People with concealable stigmatized identities face decisions on whether, when, and to whom to disclose their stigmatized status. Research has shown that disclosing one's identity yields benefits to the individual such as greater social support and increased physical and psychological health outcomes. However, further examination shows greater nuance in the matter: Some disclosures are related to more negative health outcomes, particularly when the response to the disclosure and/or the environment are/is more hostile. Moreover, recent research shows that the active concealment of a stigmatized identity may be a more reliable predictor of psychological well-being than whether a person has disclosed. Future research should consider intersecting identities, as well as the broader consequences of living with a concealable stigmatized identity.",
