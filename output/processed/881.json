    "Article Title": "A roadmap for sustainable implementation of vocational rehabilitation for people with mental disorders and its outcomes: a qualitative evaluation",
    "Abstract": "BackgroundPeople suffering from mental health disorders have lower work participation compared to people without mental challenges. To increase work participation within this group vocational rehabilitation interventions are often offered. Collaboration between the mental health care and social security sectors is needed to enable professionals to perform optimally when carrying out these interventions. Yet, regulatory and financial barriers often hinder sustainable implementation. To overcome these barriers an experimental roadmap for sustainable funding based on a shared savings strategy was piloted in four regions. The aim of the present qualitative study was to gain understanding of the uses of this roadmap and the factors that were important in the experiment's process.MethodThe roadmap consisted of five steps based upon insights from shared savings strategies and implementation science knowledge, and was initiated by a national steering board. The roadmap aimed to make sustainable funding agreements (based on shared savings) for the implementation of a vocational rehabilitation intervention. In four regions, stakeholders from the mental health care and social security services sector followed the roadmap. We conducted interviews (n = 16) with involved participants and project leaders of the experiment and collected 54 sets of field notes and documents to evaluate the roadmap process. A thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.ResultsRegions perceived improved stakeholder collaboration around vocational rehabilitation after they were guided by the roadmap. Three regions made, or intended to make, agreements on collaboration and funding, yet not based on shared savings. Moreover, going through the roadmap took more time than anticipated. Stakeholder collaboration depended on factors like personal and organizational interests and collaboration conditions and values. Financial legislation and politics were regarded as barriers and personal motives were mentioned as a facilitator in this process.ConclusionsOur study showed that the roadmap supported stakeholders to establish a more sustainable collaboration, even though no sustainable financial agreements were made yet. Although participants acknowledged the function of financial insights and the need for financial resources, the driver for collaboration was found to be more on improving clients' perspectives than on solving unfair financial distribution issues. This suggests modifying the focus of the roadmap from financial benefits to improving clients' perspectives.",
