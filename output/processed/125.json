    "Abstract": "Introduction. - Considering mental health is essential for the individual and society. Healthcare professionals are at risk of poor mental health. On the occasion of WHO World Mental Health Day on October 10th, 2021, a survey was conducted by the Occupational Health Service and the Direction of quality in Healthcare of the University Hospital of Lyon (Hospices civils de Lyon, HCL). The aim of the study was to collect the representations and beliefs of hospital staff on the/their mental health.Methods. - A short and anonymous questionnaire was sent electronically to the 22,904 HCL professionals, with a link towards a short educational video.Results. - Seven hundred and sixty-six responses were collected. Representations of mental health were generally positive among professionals, with a transactional vision including known determinants such as living and working conditions. The most chosen words related to mental health were equilibrium and well-being. The measures considered to be the most relevant by professionals to promote mental health were the establishment of rest bubble times, times for discussions (colleagues and management), prevention programs, easier access to a psy and to the occupational health service.Conclusion. - This survey contributed to a better understanding of the representations of HCL professionals regarding mental health and to their awareness in this field. These results can be used to develop a mental health promotion plan in the workplace, adapted to hospital professionals.",
