However, despite this interest, empirical studies investigating the effect of workplace isolation on employees' behavior OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between workplace isolation and psychological well-being in light of the mediating role of perceived organizational support and the moderating role of job insecurity. METHODS: Within the scope of the research, teleworkers in accordance with the isolation rules was used as a criterion for the selection of the participants. In this vein, data collected from 382 respondents were investigated using structural equation modelling analysis. RESULTS: The results indicate that (1) workplace isolation positively relate to perceived organizational support and negatively related to psychological well-being, (2) perceived organizational support positively relate to psychological wellbeing, (3) perceived organizational support mediates the relationship between workplace isolation and psychological well-being, and (4) job insecurity moderates the relationship between perceived organizational support and psychological well-being.
