    "Article Title": "Exploring the Relationship Between Familiarity With the ICF and Rehabilitation Counselor Confidence in Facilitating Workplace Accommodations",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: The International Classification of Functioning (ICF) provides a framework for understanding and accommodating disability. This study examined predictors and outcomes of ICF familiarity among rehabilitation counselors.Method: Analysis of variance and hierarchical regression analysis were used to examine research questions related to ICF familiarity.Results: Rehabilitation counselors with five or fewer years of experience were more familiar with the ICF. Analysis showed familiarity with the ICF positively correlated with greater confidence in recommending work accommodations.Conclusions: Data supports use of the ICF in rehabilitation counseling. Emphasizing the ICF in specific courses (e.g., medical aspects of disability, career and vocational development) may support improved practice.",
