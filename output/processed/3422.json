    "Abstract": "Objective: The objective of this research was to investigate contemporary Chinese college students' perceptions of the good mother.Background: Increased lifestyle and self-fulfillment choices have recently become available for college-age students in China. However, there is government, societal, and family pressure for women to be married, ideally by 25 years of age, and to bear children as a patriotic and socially stabilizing duty.Method: A qualitative study using thematic analysis to code data from semistructured interviews with 20 male and female college students.Results: Five attributes of a good mother were identified: is a guide, is loving, communicates with her child as with a friend, is not overcontrolling, and balances paid work and time with her child.Conclusion: This study contributes to ongoing research across cultures and societies, which aims to understand what young adults believe to be a good mother and how this may affect their future parenting practices. Within the Chinese context, perceptions of a good mother include traditional echoes-for example, mother as primary caregivermixed with contemporary ideas-for example, pursuing the right to seek personal fulfillment and financial autonomy and a move away from a top-down authoritarian style of parenting. Gendered perceptions of physical punishment, childrearing anxiety, and parental sacrifice were identified.Implications: Future policymakers should provide greater social and workplace options and implement support services to alleviate the anxiety women experience in their dual aspirations to succeed in paid work and to be good mothers. Educating men regarding their contribution to caregiving and the fostering of family harmony should also be prioritized.",
