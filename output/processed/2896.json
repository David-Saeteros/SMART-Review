    "Abstract": "ObjectiveDisruption to working lives spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic may shape people's preferences for future employment. We aimed to identify the components of work prioritized by a UK sample and the employment changes they had considered since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsA nationally representative longitudinal household survey was conducted in Wales at two time points between 2020 and 2021.ResultsThose in poorer health prioritized flexibility and were more likely to consider retiring. Those with limiting preexisting conditions or low mental well-being were more likely to consider becoming self-employed. Those experiencing financial insecurity (including those with high wage precarity or those furloughed) were more likely to consider retraining, becoming self-employed, or securing permanent employment.ConclusionsEnsuring flexible, secure, and autonomous work is accessible for individuals facing greater employment-related insecurity may be key.",
