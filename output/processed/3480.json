    "Abstract": "Background Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are expected to identify and respond to domestic abuse (DA) among their patients. Although research suggests that a high proportion of HCPs are affected by DA, the impact of their experiences has been under-researched.Aims To assess UK HCPs' experiences of DA and develop a broad understanding of its impact on work and HCPs' support needs.Methods An online cross-sectional survey was promoted via multiple professional channels (October to December 2022). We adopted convenience sampling and analysed data descriptively.Results Among the 192 HCP survivors who responded, all abuse subtypes-psychological, sexual, economic and physical-were common. Ninety per cent of abusers were male (ex)partners. Eighty-five per cent reported abusers directly interfered with their work and 92% reported their work and career were affected. Almost all reported physical and mental health consequences. Eighty-nine per cent reported their own experiences shaped their responses to patient survivors. On average, per year, HCP survivors reported they had 13 sick days, 5 days' leave, 10 days' lateness and 6 days' early departure due to DA. Only 20% reported their workplace had a staff DA policy, and over 50% were unsure what workplace support mechanisms were available. Just over half disclosed at work; concerns that others would question their fitness to practice were common. Twenty-two per cent reported aspects of work, for example, long hours, stopped them from seeking support outside work.Conclusions HCPs face unique barriers to DA disclosure and support-seeking and may benefit from tailored support from specialists who understand both DA and the healthcare context.Domestic abuse (DA) is highly prevalent and damages health. Healthcare professionals are expected to identify DA and refer patients to support services, but scant research has explored healthcare professionals' own experiences of DA. Our study highlights the wide-ranging harms of DA on their work and careers, including on patient care. Numerous work-related barriers hinder support-seeking both at work and from specialist services.",
