    "Abstract": "Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate (1) the type and frequency of reported life events of the East German population related to the German reunification and (2) their associations with psychosocial health.Methods: Data of 2247 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania was used. These qualitative responses were analysed using quantitative content analysis. Their associations with subjective physical and mental health, optimism, social support, depressive symptoms, and chronic stress were examined.Results: Eight life event categories were identified (education, employment-related changes, material changes, new opportunities, personal life events, politics, separations, reunifications). Especially, experiencing new opportunities was associated with a higher level of optimism as well as a lower level of depressive symptoms and chronic stress.Conclusions: In this study, events frequently described in the literature (e.g., employment-related and social changes) were confirmed and systematized. The observed associations of these events with psychosocial factors should be examined further in future studies.",
