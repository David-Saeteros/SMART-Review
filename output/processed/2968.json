    "Abstract": "Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been coping with high levels of stress during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, affecting their employment, physical, and mental health, and overall life satisfaction. Objective: This study evaluated constructs of the stress-appraisal-coping theory and positive person-environment factors as predictors of subjective well-being for adults with MS. Method: Participants included 477 adults with MS recruited through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the incremental variance in subjective well-being accounted for by demographic covariates, functional disability, perceived stress, stress appraisal, coping styles, and positive person-environment contextual factors. Results: Positive stress appraisal and coping flexibility were significantly associated with subjective well-being at the bivariate correlation level and at the step they were entered into the regression model. Marital status, household income, functional disability, perceived stress, hope, core self-evaluations, and social support were significant predictors in the final model, accounting for 60% of the variance in subjective well-being scores (R-2 = .60, f(2) = 1.48; large effect size). Conclusions: Findings from this study support a stress management and well-being model based on constructs of Lazarus and Folkman's stress-appraisal-coping theory and positive person-environment contextual factors, which can inform the development of theory-driven and empirically supported stress management and well-being interventions for people with MS during the ongoing global health crisis.Impact and ImplicationsThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly disrupted the lives of people around the world and disproportionately affected the disability community, including people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition to managing stressors and challenges associated with chronic disease, people with MS must also cope with high levels of stress and anxiety during the ongoing pandemic, which can acutely affect their physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. Therefore, effective stress management and well-being interventions that can be provided remotely, in person, and blended are needed to help individuals with MS manage disease complications and stress levels. This study evaluated constructs of the stress-appraisal-coping theory and positive person-environment contextual factors as predictors of subjective well-being in adults with MS. Findings suggested that positive personality traits and supportive environments may play a role as protective factors against perceived stress and facilitate subjective well-being. Importantly, findings of this study can be used to guide the development of theory-driven and empirically supported stress management, health promotion, and psychological interventions for people with MS during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",
