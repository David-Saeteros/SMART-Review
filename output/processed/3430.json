    "Article Title": "Significant liver fibrosis is a predictor of poor health-related quality of life in people living with HIV",
    "Abstract": "Purpose Liver-related comorbidities can impair the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH). However, the role of hepatic steatosis and significant fibrosis in PLWH remains incompletely characterized. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the association of hepatic steatosis and significant fibrosis on the HRQL using the medical outcomes study HIV health survey (MOS-HIV) in PLWH. Methods A total of 222 PLWH were included in the final analysis of this cohort study. Metabolic comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and HIV-related parameters were assessed. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were measured using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE). The MOS-HIV survey, containing two summary scores (physical health summary (PHS) and mental health summary (MHS)) and ten domains, was used to assess the HRQL. Clinical predictors were identified using multivariable linear regression models. Results The majority of this cohort was male, and the median age was 52 years, with a high prevalence of hepatic steatosis (n = 81, 36.5%). Significant fibrosis was present in 7.7% (n = 17). The mean PHS and MHS scores were 52.7 +/- 9.5 and 51.4 +/- 10.5, respectively. The lowest scores were in the general health perception (GHP) and energy/fatigue (EF) domains. A high BMI and waist circumference were associated with a poor PHS score. Lower education, unemployment, arterial hypertension, and significant fibrosis remained independent predictors of an impaired HRQL. Conclusion Metabolic comorbidities, significant fibrosis, and a lower socioeconomic status may negatively affect the HRQL in PLWH. Considering the negative impact of significant fibrosis on the outcome, counseling and preventive measures according to current guidelines are recommended in this subgroup of PLWH.",
