    "Article Title": "Socio-Medical and Personality Correlates of Psychological Well-Being among People Living with HIV: a Latent Profile Analysis",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the heterogeneity of the sample of people living with HIV (PLWH) in terms of psychological well-being (PWB) using the latent profile analysis. Participants were 530 people with confirmed diagnosis of HIV+. The study was cross-sectional with psychological well-being operationalized by health related quality of life (WHO Quality of Life-BREF), satisfaction with life (Satisfaction with Life Scale) and positive and negative general affect (PANAS-X). The Big Five personality traits were measured with the NEO-FFI questionnaire. Additionally, socio-medical data were obtained. The statistical analysis proved the heterogeneity of PWB among the studied patient group: model with 6 different PWB profiles was best-fitted to the data. Employment, education, and personality traits, especially neuroticism, turned out to be significant for PWB profile membership. In contrast, medical variables were not related to the PWB profile membership among participants. Research on PWB among PLWH in so called person-centred approach by distinguishing their different subgroups may be an adjunct to develop more effective methods of psychological counselling for PLWH, especially in the light of findings that objective health status is not necessarily a strong explanatory variable of PWB's variance in these patients.",
