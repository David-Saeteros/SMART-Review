    "Article Title": "Resilience in Solitude: A Review of Loneliness and Its Impact on Nurses' Wellbeing",
    "Abstract": "The issue of loneliness among nurses is of considerable importance, with potential ramifications extending beyond the well-being of the individuals involved to the quality of patient care delivered. This review explores the topic in-depth, guided by the recognition that the considerable influence of loneliness on nurses' welfare warrants extensive examination and evaluation. The rationale for undertaking this review is to understand and communicate the wide-reaching implications of loneliness within the nursing profession. In this narrative review, we tried to elucidate the prevalence, causes, and impacts of loneliness among nurses globally. We explored various theoretical frameworks and empirical studies to illuminate the factors contributing to loneliness within this population and analyzed the prevalence rates with other professions. The review further discussed the consequences of loneliness on nurses' physical and mental health, job performance, and financial and systemic implications for healthcare institutions. It evaluates the role of the workplace environment. It explores various coping strategies and interventions to manage loneliness, including self-help techniques, formal support structures, workplace programs, and technology-based solutions. The review revealed that factors influencing loneliness include social, environmental, and cultural elements. Studies highlight that being widowed, divorced, older, male, or from an immigrant background, low physical activity, unemployment, low income, and poor-quality relationships are significant predictors of loneliness. Physical health issues like chronic illnesses and mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety also contribute to feelings of loneliness among nurses. We also forward recommendations for healthcare institutions, policy changes, and future research needs, ultimately underscoring the importance of addressing loneliness among nurses. The review concludes with a call to action for all stakeholders to prioritize the emotional well-being of nurses, fostering a healthcare environment that nurtures resilience and thereby enhances the quality of patient care.",
