    "Abstract": "The exploratory study presented in this article looks into the possible differences in psychosocial aspects (self-esteem and locus of control) and aspects of psychopathology (depression, anxiety, melancholia, asthenia, and mania) amongst sighted adults and adults with visual impairments. Moreover, the study aims to examine the possible correlations between psychosocial aspects and aspects of psychopathology of adults with visual impairments. Furthermore, this study examines the possible relationships between the above psychological aspects and the individual features of the participants (age, gender, age at onset of visual impairments, how recent the loss of vision is, marital status, employment status, and ability of independent mobility). One hundred and forty-eight adults participated in the study: 55 adults with visual impairments and 93 sighted adults. The research was based upon the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, and the Symptoms Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety. The results reveal correlations between psychosocial aspects and psychopathology of adults with visual impairments. Moreover, the individual features influence the psychosocial aspects and psychopathology of the participants.",
