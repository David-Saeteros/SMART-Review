    "Article Title": "Recovery Ecosystems A Whole Health Approach to Substance Use Prevention and Treatment",
    "Abstract": "A recovery ecosystem is an evidencebased approach that creates the environment that individuals and families need by providing all the necessary tools, services, and supports for recovery to occur. Several models have been proposed in the literature, including the recovery-oriented systems of care model and Recovery Ready Ecosystems Model. A major concern with previous models is lack of focus on how the individual with substance use disorder (SUD) is a partner in the recovery process and interacts with the recovery ecosystem to optimize recovery wrap-around services and supports. Therefore, we propose the SUD Holistic Recovery Ecosystem Model (HREM), which uses a whole health approach to substance use prevention and treatment and builds on prior work by other researchers. The HREM has four domains: health support, social welfare support, occupational support, and legal and legislative support.",
