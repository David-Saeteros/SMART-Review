    "Article Title": "Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatment for Individuals with Early Psychosis",
    "Abstract": "Coordinated specialty care (CSC) first-episode models are an evidence based practice in the treatment of first-episode psychosis. Group, individual, and family therapies in CSC aim to help the client and family understand and cope with the experience of psychosis, promote symptomatic and functional recovery and improve quality of life, and support the pursuit of personally meaningful goals of the client. Common elements to these interventions include building a therapeutic alliance, recovery orientation, education, and skills training, which can be directed to a range of targets, including problem-solving, communication, social skills, and social cognition.",
