    "Abstract": "Introduction: The aim of this research was to evaluate a large-scale implementation of evidence-based supported employment for people with severe mental illness, at 17 locations throughout Sussex, England.Method: A parallel group observational design was used to evaluate an implementation of the individual placement and support approach to supported employment. Three sites provided both a comparison pre-individual placement and support cohort (n=140), and a new post-individual placement and support cohort (n=107) as part of the individual placement and support implementation (n=446). All individual placement and support sites involved community mental health teams forming partnerships with Southdown Supported Employment to co-locate an employment specialist into each mental health team. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants commencing competitive employment during the follow-up period.Results: The new individual placement and support sites attained higher fidelity with respect to individual placement and support principles and practices (mean 97 of 125) than the pre-individual placement and support sites (mean 77 of 125). Significantly more individual placement and support participants commenced competitive employment than pre-individual placement and support participants (24.9% vs 14.3%). Individual placement and support participants experienced less delay before commencing their first job (153 vs 371 days), and when employed, worked more hours per week (24.3 vs 15.4 hours).Conclusion: This implementation of individual placement and support in Sussex improved on the previous vocational services. Although progress is encouraging there is much room for improvement. More resources appear needed to support programme development, specifically to strengthen site-level management, training, technical support, fidelity assessment, programme monitoring, and outcome evaluation.",
