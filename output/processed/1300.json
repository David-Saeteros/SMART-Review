    "Abstract": "Objective: To determine associations between work and non-work supports with employee well-being, job stress, and burnout among direct and non-direct care healthcare workers. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 550 full-time (>= 35 h/wk), US Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (>= 18 years of age) in the healthcare industry, had at least one supervisor, and at least one coworker. Canonical correlational analysis assessed the shared variance of organizational, supervisor, coworker, and family/friend support on employee outcomes. Results: Non-direct care support workers indicated a significantly stronger association between work supports and employee outcomes than family/friend supports. Direct care support workers had significant support from both work and non-work sources of support. Conclusion: Workplace supports are important resources for healthcare workers responsible for ensuring patient care and safety. Workplace interventions may tailor interventions to encourage types of support for subgroups within the healthcare industry.",
