    "Abstract": "Solo motherhood is a family constellation that is becoming increasingly common in high income countries. The demographic characteristics of solo women entering treatment with donated sperm or embryo have been shown to be different from that of cohabiting women. The general importance of perceived social support is frequently amplified when health and quality of life are concerned, and positively affects mental health status, experienced stress, perceived self-efficacy during the transition to parenthood and during parenthood itself. The objective of the present study was to compare demographic characteristics, social network and perceived social support among solo women and cohabiting women awaiting fertility treatment. This objective was explored with a study-specific demographic and background questionnaire as well as through questions on access to practical support and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) assessing different sources of support. This study is a part of a longitudinal prospective multicenter study of solo women who awaited donation treatment in six Swedish public and private fertility clinics and a comparison group of women who were cohabiting/married to male partner and awaited in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment with the couple's own gametes. A total of 670 women were invited and 463 accepted participation (69% response rate); 207 solo women (study group) and 256 cohabiting women (comparison group). The results show significant differences in age, education, and employment between the groups. Solo women were on average 3.6 years older, had a higher level of education, a higher-income profession, and were more frequently working full time. Solo women perceived an equally high degree of social support from their families, significantly higher levels of support from friends and significantly lower support from a significant other compared to cohabiting women. Solo women expected their mother to be the most supportive person in future parenthood, while cohabiting women most often stated their cohabiting partner to fill that role. The study adds to the body of knowledge of solo women as a sociodemographic distinct group going at motherhood alone, stating a high degree of currently perceived and expected social support. The previously studied negative impact that lack of a co-parent might have, may be attenuated by the expected and perceived social support from family and friends.",
