    "Article Title": "Factors predicting employment status among persons with schizophrenia: A cross-sectional study from Chennai, India",
    "Abstract": "Background: Even among other mental disorders, a diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with an abnormally low employment rate. However, those who can find employment report mental health improvements and diminishing symptoms.Aims: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed a variety of sociodemographic factors between groups of schizophrenia-diagnosed employed and unemployed individuals to attempt to determine any causal relationships.Methods: A group of 52 employed and 48 unemployed individuals from the same outpatient hospital were surveyed. Patients were asked about their sociodemographic background and employment history, as well as subjected to a variety of tests to quantify critical aspects of their symptomatology. These included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were administered to assess comorbid depression and anxiety. Lastly, the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) measured any extrapyramidal side effects caused by the patients' medications.Results: Initial analysis by the Student's t-test and chi-square test revealed correlations between employment status and symptomatology, but upon performing logistic regression, peer support was found to be the only significant predictor of employment status (OR = 0.119, CI [0.40, 0.354], p = .001). Based on these results, the creation of peer support systems at work through fostering inclusive, well-informed, and destigmatized environments should be employers' predominant focus.Conclusion: Future studies conducted longitudinally can strengthen the conclusions found and confirm the optimal manners in which to address the matter of aiding the integration of schizophrenic and similarly symptomatic individuals into the labor force.",
