    "Abstract": "This research contributes to a innovative approach to address the increasing issues of workplace mental health and stress, particularly in high-pressure environments like assembly lines which also affects workers performance and companies productivity. Recognizing the harmful effects of stress on worker productivity, this study introduce stress-monitoring model using advanced machine learning techniques. Proposed model integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology and machine learning techniques, utilizing a wearable watch to gather open-source physiological data indicative of workers stress in assembly lines. Key physiological markers, such as heart rate, respiration rate, and skin conductance, are analyzed. Based on these physiological indicators, the primary objective is to develop and validate framework that can accurately predict worker stress levels using IoT and machine learning models. The empirical results of the proposed approach demonstrate that the most effective model achieves an impressive accuracy score, with the XGBoost model providing 99% accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.99, surpassing the performance of Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The practical implications of these findings suggest a significant potential for implementing such technology in high-stress work settings, offering a proactive tool for stress management and contributing to enhanced worker well-being and productivity.",
