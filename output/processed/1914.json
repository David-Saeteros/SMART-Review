    "Article Title": "A Qualitative Investigation of the Experiences of People Who Panhandle",
    "Abstract": "U.S. Census data from 2016 indicate that 12.7% of the population may be living in poverty, a total of 40.6 million people. The most visible among this group facing unemployment or underemployment are people who panhandle, characterized by soliciting requests for assistance on street corners or highway exits. If issues of poverty are to be addressed adequately, the characteristics of these populations need to be better understood. In this qualitative study, we sought to understand the experiences of people who panhandle through in-person interviews. Participants included 9 individuals (6 men and 3 women). A consensual qualitative research approach was used to analyze the transcribed interviews resulting in 7 domains. We discuss results in the context of the psychology of working theory. Implications include the integration of social justice and vocational psychology among counseling psychologists working with clients who panhandle.",
