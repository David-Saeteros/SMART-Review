    "Abstract": "This study investigated the mental health help-seeking intentions and its correlates among Chinese international students in the U.S. higher education system. An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted. Recruitment of participants occurred via a social media campaign, and participants were invited to complete an online anonymous survey. A total of 222 Chinese international students participated in the study. The majority of the participants were female (65.3%), graduate students (84.7%), and the only child in the family (83.8%). The participants had a mean age of 23.75 years old. When encountering mental health-related problems, participants reported the highest help-seeking intentions for an intimate partner, parent, and friend. A higher level of general mental health help-seeking intentions was associated with a higher level of coping self-efficacy, a higher level of social support, a lower level of stigma, being undergraduate students, and having no history of full-time employment. These findings indicated the preferred sources for mental health help seeking and the need to improve the general mental health help seeking among Chinese international students. Culturally tailored programs are needed that take into consideration Chinese cultural attitudes and beliefs with regard to mental and emotional symptoms of distress.",
