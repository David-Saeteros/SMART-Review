    "Article Title": "Differences in health-related quality of life and somatic symptoms in employed and unemployed patients with epilepsy",
    "Abstract": "This study compared overall and specific aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and self-report of somatic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms between employed (n = 71) and unemployed (n = 48) patients with epilepsy (PWE). The Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-89) and the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) were examined. The unemployed group reported significantly worse overall HRQOL including aspects of HRQOL related to epilepsy, physical health, mental health, and cognitive function. Among these four, physical health related HRQOL revealed the most difference between groups. While there were no differences between the groups in the level of social support and social isolation, the unemployed group reported worse social function with respect to work and driving. The unemployed group reported significantly greater somatic symptoms, but not anxiety and depressive symptoms. When specifically examining the subscales of the Somatic Concerns scale, conversion and health concerns, but not somatization, were greater in the unemployed group. Among the Depression subscales, the unemployed group reported greater physiologically manifested depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that along with optimizing seizure control, identifying and addressing presence of physical limitations, dysfunction, and somatic symptoms are also of importance in the care of PWE, particularly for those who are unemployed.",
