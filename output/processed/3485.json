    "Article Title": "The influence of psychosocial work characteristics on the need for recovery from work: a prospective study among computer workers",
    "Abstract": "To investigate the influence of high job demands, low job control, and high social support on need for recovery (NFR) among computer workers.Data was obtained from a longitudinal cohort study, including 5 consecutive measurements, with an in-between period of 6 months. General estimating equations analyses were performed to assess the risk for high NFR 6 months later. Odds ratios (ORs) for high NFR were calculated for high job demands, low job control and low social support, separately. Likewise, ORs were calculated for combinations of job demands and job control, as well as for combinations of job demands, job control and social support.High job demands resulted in an increased risk for high NFR 6 months later, particularly in older workers. Low social support showed also an increased risk for future high NFR, but this was not the case for low job control. Furthermore, a combination of high job demands and low job control, as well as a combination of high job demands, low job control and low social support demonstrated an increased risk for future high NFR where older workers showed higher risks.This study demonstrated that adverse psychosocial work characteristics predicted future NFR among computer workers.",
