    "Article Title": "Predicting Return to Work Following Myocardial Infarction: A Prospective Longitudinal Cohort Study",
    "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine the proportion of patients who returned to work within three months post-myocardial infarction and the factors that predicted return to work. A total of 136 participants with myocardial infarction completed the study questionnaires at baseline and three months post-discharge between August 2015 and February 2016. At the three-month follow-up, 87.5% (n = 49) of the participants who were working pre-infarction had resumed work. Age, gender, education, smoking, readmission after discharge, number of comorbidities, diabetes, social support, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with returning to work at three months post-discharge. Age, gender, smoking, anxiety, and depression significantly predicted those patients with myocardial infarction that returned to work, using binary logistic regression. The majority of patients in work who experience myocardial infarction have the capacity to achieve a work resumption by three months post-discharge. Interventions that facilitate returning to work should focus on modifiable risk factors, such as improving these patients' mental health, comorbid conditions, risk of readmission, smoking, and social support. Healthcare providers should work in partnership with patients' family members, friends, and employers in developing and implementing interventions to address these modifiable factors to facilitate patients' return to work.",
