    "Abstract": "Introduction: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are one of the greatest causes of work absenteeism and an enormous economic burden for employers globally. Employees report they still go to work despite being in pain, leading to decreased productivity, potentially representing an even greater economic cost than absenteeism. The evidence in favour of occupational health services such as manual therapy, does not only serve as an early intervention but as a strong preventive opportunity for work-related musculoskeletal pain. This article discusses the potential bene fits for businesses if they employed manual therapists. Methods: Evidence was sought on the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders to identify the ef- ficacy of spinal manipulation and mobilization and techniques commonly employed by manual therapists to manage common musculoskeletal disorders. Results: The body of evidence itself was not at all extensive so this opinion article provides information needed to build a stronger argument for the use of health professionals trained in manual therapy for work environments with the broader goal of creating opportunities for further research to be developed on reducing absenteeism from musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusions: The bene fits of having these professionals intervening on-site, for employees and workers alike, are evident and could be a potentially provide a competitive advantage. Worker satisfaction and productivity is increased with manual therapy interventions at the workplace, while reducing the economic burden of ab- senteeism. Further research should be developed to explore the cost e ffectiveness of manual therapy in the on reducing absenteeism from musculoskeletal disorders in the workplace.",
