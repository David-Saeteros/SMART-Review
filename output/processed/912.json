    "Abstract": "Background Severe pain and chronic pain have a high impact on individuals and society. Body location of pain is important with regard to perception, articulation, and underlying biological, mental or social causes of pain.Methods A cross-sectional survey was performed in the general Austrian population with 15,474 personally interviewed subjects aged 15 years and older.Results The 1-year period prevalence of severe pain in any body site was 38.6% and of chronic pain 24.9%. In all, 8.1% had pain in at least three body sites. Subjects aged 65 years and older (52.2%), those with low education (43.4%), unemployed subjects (50.4%), retired subjects (52.4%), those with anxiety/depression (67.7%), and subjects with lack of social support (49.6%) were sub-populations with high pain prevalence. In multivariate analyses, depression/anxiety was associated with prevalence and chronicity of severe pain in all body sites (range of ORs 1.89-5.01), while such associations were found for lack of social support (range of ORs 1.33-1.65), female sex (range of ORs 1.38-2.34), higher age (range of ORs 1.09-1.18 for 5 year intervals), as well as low educational (range of ORs 1.47-2.06 primary vs. tertiary education) and unemployment status (range of ORs 1.50-2.62) in most body sites. Being born in non-EU or EFTA states was associated with pain in many body sites (range of ORs 1.38-2.10).Conclusions Psychosocial factors are associated with pain presence in similar ways irrespective of location. Regarding socio-demographic factors, differences towards the magnitude and the direction in the association with pain frequency and chronicity in different body sites emerged.",
