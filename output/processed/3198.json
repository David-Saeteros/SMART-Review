    "Article Title": "An examination of parents' perceptions of developmental disability, social support, and health outcomes among Chinese American parents of children with developmental disabilities",
    "Abstract": "Asian immigrant parents raising children with developmental disabilities experience frustration, stress, social isolation, and poor health outcomes. Based on data collected from 55 Chinese American parents of children with developmental disabilities, this study examined the relationships between individual characteristics, parents' perceptions of developmental disability, social support, severity of disability, and parents' self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. The findings showed that Chinese American parents exhibited different pathways for better health outcomes. Overall social support, specific support from family and friends/co-workers, and community involvement were significant correlates of maternal self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. Fear of stigmatization was significantly and positively associated with maternal depressive symptoms. Similarly, education and employment status correlated with paternal self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. The ages of parents and their children were found to be negatively correlated with paternal depressive symptoms. The child's disability severity level was not associated with parents' self-reported physical health and depressive symptoms. The findings also confirmed that parents' self-reported physical health status was significantly and negatively associated with their own depressive symptoms. Chinese American mothers experienced poor physical health and greater depressive symptoms compared to Chinese American fathers. The study's clinical implications and limitations are discussed.",
