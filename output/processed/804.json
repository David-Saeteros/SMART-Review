    "Abstract": "Background In the face of an increasingly aging, multimorbid, chronically ill workforce, company health promotion (BGF) is an important instrument for promoting and maintaining the health of employees in the workplace. Due to digitization and the increasing possibilities of working from home, digital offers for workplace health promotion (dBGF) are being used increasingly in organizations. The portfolio of offers ranges from fitness trackers, online platforms, and health apps to so-called wearables, so that a broad, individual selection is possible for both organizations and employees.The aim of the study The aim of the study was to identify and analyze randomized controlled trials (RCT) with regard to the health-promoting effectiveness of dBGF.Material and methods A systematic literature search was carried out in relevant specialist databases (PubMed, Livivo, Cochrane Library). The identified studies were selected, evaluated and then descriptively presented by several people systematically and independently.Results 17 relevant contributions could be identified and analyzed. Above all, measures to promote physical activity and programs to improve mental health were identified in the RCT studies that were carried out. The results of the studies carried out indicate that dBGF can promote health in a variety of ways and support organizations in providing a health-promoting working environment.Discussion The effectiveness of dBGF could be proven on the basis of the studies identified, whereby the effects are undoubtedly influenced and determined by the employees, above all by their health competence. In order to ensure the long-term effectiveness of dBGF, it will be necessary in the future to increase the interest and motivation of employees with regard to personal health promotion and illness prevention.",
