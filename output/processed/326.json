    "Abstract": "Mental illnesses and behavioral disorders are very common among the working population, affecting up to a third of employees each year, and are associated with great suffering, the risk of chronicity, and the loss of employment. Economically, mental illnesses cause high costs. In order to mitigate these consequences and increase the chances of recovery, rapid diagnosis, early and appropriate treatment where necessary, and-over and above the usual psychotherapy approach-attention to the work-related causes are of crucial importance. Psychotherapeutic Consultation at the Workplace (PT-A) attempts to meet these requirements. It offers psychotherapeutic help at short notice and close to the workplace for employees suffering from mental stress; provides (depending on the problem) counseling, diagnostics, prevention, and short-term or bridging therapy; and supports reintegration after a longer period of mental illness. It is helpful to cooperate closely with the company medical service, which consults the PT-A, refers employees to it, provides information on the company situation, and can support reintegration if necessary. Funding is often provided by the company but can also be provided by health insurance companies in integrated care models. This article begins by describing the history and principles of PT-A and the role of work stress in the development of psychological and psychosomatic disorders. The implementation of PT-A is then outlined using two examples. Finally, the current study Early Intervention at the Workplace (Fr & uuml;he Intervention am Arbeitsplatz [friaa]), to which several articles in this special issue refer, is briefly presented.",
