    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions could adversely affect long-term HIV care. We evaluated the experiences of people receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) through a decentralized delivery program in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. We telephoned a random subsample of participants enrolled in a prospective cohort study in KwaZulu-Natal in April and May 2020 and administered a semi-structured telephone interview to consenting participants. We completed interviews with 303 of 638 contacted participants (47%); 66% were female, with median age 36y. The most common concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic were food running out (121, 40%), fear of becoming infected with COVID-19 (103, 34%), and being unable to work/losing employment or income (102, 34%). Twenty-five (8%) participants had delayed ART pick-up due to the pandemic, while 212 (70%) had new concerns about ART access going forward. Mental health scores were worse during the pandemic compared to baseline (median score 65.0 vs 80.0, p < 0.001). Decentralized ART distribution systems have the potential to support patients outside of health facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, but economic concerns and mental health impacts related to the pandemic must also be recognized and addressed.",
