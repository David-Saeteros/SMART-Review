    "Article Title": "A step toward understanding the association between depressive symptoms and workplace support: documenting the mediating roles of unproductivity and self-disclosure",
    "Abstract": "PurposeIn this manuscript, the authors argue that those suffering from depressive symptoms are prone to experiencing bouts of unproductivity. The authors argue further that such conditions promote instances of self-disclosure regarding related symptoms in the interest of procuring workplace support, i.e. the effect of depressive symptomology on workplace support is mediated by both unproductivity and self-disclosure, in turn.Design/methodology/approachTwo different online investigations were implemented to assess the accuracy of this prediction. Moreover, two different samples of organizational employees from numerous organizations were procured, such that one sample contained diagnosed individuals, whereas the other contained undiagnosed individuals (total N = 756). In general, the main analyses consisted of confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis.FindingsSubstantial statistical support was obtained for the authors' four-variable path model. Specifically, across two different investigations, a model was found in which those with depressive symptoms were unproductive, which prompted self-disclosure and thus subsequent manifestations of workplace support. Moreover, this was generally true for both diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals. Correlation coefficients and model fit indices are reported in the manuscript.Originality/valueThis work contributes substantially to the understanding of how depressive symptomology, self-disclosure and workplace support are interrelated within organizations. In addition, having examined these relationships using a sample of undiagnosed individuals, new insights were gained regarding a subset of the population that remains vastly understudied.",
