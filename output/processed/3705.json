    "Article Title": "Describing Occupational Health Nursing Interventions and Outcomes in Hair Stylist Apprentices With Hand Eczema Using the Omaha System as a Framework",
    "Abstract": "The Omaha System is one of the most applicable classification systems and can be used effectively to recognize occupational health nurse(s) in practice. Describing occupational health nurse interventions and outcomes can be an example for planning care in a specific case such as hair stylist apprentices with hand eczema symptoms by using the Omaha System. The study consists of 15 cases. The Turkish-Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire was used for data collection related to eczema symptoms. The assessment was made by using electronic health record system based on the Omaha System. For the 15 cases, 113 problems and 624 nursing interventions were reported. According to the Omaha System's Problem Classification Scheme, the frequently diagnosed problems were skin (100%), neighborhood/workplace safety (100%), health care supervision (67%), respiration (53%), and pain (40%). The identified intervention categories were 98.5% about teaching, guidance, and counseling; 89.2% about surveillance; and 6.4% about case management. The occupational health nursing outcomes scores were more likely to show higher level after the intervention (p < .05). The Omaha System can be effectively used in occupational healthcare settings for specific cases in workplaces.",
