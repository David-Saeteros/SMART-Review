    "Article Title": "Caregivers' experiences and perspectives of factors associated with relapse in Iranian people living with schizophrenia: A qualitative study",
    "Abstract": "Background: Relapse in People Living with Schizophrenia (PLS) has several reasons and recognizing these can increase the effectiveness of treatment interventions. Formal and informal caregivers are an informed source to reduce relapse in PLS. Aim: This study explores the caregivers' perspective in Iran on the factors affecting relapse in PLS. Method: A total of 28 caregivers (16 formal caregivers and 12 informal caregivers) of PLS were enrolled in our qualitative study. A content analysis was conducted using individual and group, semi-structured in-depth interviews with informal and formal caregivers of PLS. This study was conducted in a hospital, three universities, and a non-governmental organization in Tehran, Iran. Results: The majority (69%) of the participants were females. About half of the informal caregivers were over 60 years old and about 40% of the formal caregivers were in the age range of 30 to 40 years. The average number of years of work for informal caregivers was 17.6 years and the average of work experience among the formal caregivers was 14.1 years. Seven key dual themes were identified from data: 'awareness-stigma', 'social support-social exclusion', 'treatment adherence-treatment discontinuation', 'holistic approach - one-dimensional approach', 'supported employment-social dysfunction', 'emotional management in family - family with high emotional expression', and 'access to treatment-treatment gap'. Conclusion: The results of this research can help practitioners and policymakers to enable evidence-based practices to reduce relapse in PLS by emphasizing and acting on factors identified in our analyses.",
