    "Article Title": "Scoping review of military veterans involved in the criminal legal system and their health and healthcare: 5-year update and map to the Veterans-Sequential Intercept Model",
    "Abstract": "Background A previous scoping review of legal-involved veterans' health and healthcare (1947-2017) identified studies and their limitations. Given the influx of literature published recently, this study aimed to update the previous review and map articles to the Veterans-Sequential Intercept Model (V-SIM) - a conceptual model used by key partners, including Veterans Health Administration, veteran advocates, criminal justice practitioners, and local governments to identify intercept points in the criminal legal system where resources and programming can be provided. Developing an updated resource of literature is essential to inform current research, discover gaps, and highlight areas for future research.Methods A systematic search of 5 databases identified articles related to legal-involved veterans' health and healthcare published between December 2017 through December 2022. The first and senior authors conducted abstract reviews, full-text reviews, and data extraction of study characteristics. Finally, each article was sorted by the various intercept points from the V-SIM.Results Of 903 potentially relevant articles, 107 peer-reviewed publications were included in this review, most related to mental health (66/107, 62%) and used an observational quantitative study design (95/107, 89%). Although most articles did not explicitly use the V-SIM to guide data collection, analyses, or interpretation, all could be mapped to this conceptual model. Half of the articles (54/107, 50%) collected data from intercept 5 (Community Corrections and Support Intercept) of the V-SIM. No articles gathered data from intercepts 0 (Community and Emergency Services Intercept), 1 (Law Enforcement Intercept), or 2 (Initial Detention and Court Hearings Intercept).Conclusions There were 107 articles published in the last five years compared to 190 articles published in 70 years covered in the last review, illustrating the growing interest in legal-involved veterans. The V-SIM is widely used by front-line providers and clinical leadership, but not by researchers to guide their work. By clearly tying their research to the V-SIM, researchers could generate results to help guide policy and practice at specific intercept points. Despite the large number of publications, research on prevention and early intervention for legal-involved veterans is lacking, indicating areas of great need for future studies.",
