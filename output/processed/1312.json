    "Article Title": "Burnout and Perceptions of Stigma and Help-Seeking Behavior Among Pediatric Fellows",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although burnout has been studied extensively among students and residents, in few studies have researchers examined burnout among fellowship trainees. We measured burnout among fellows in our freestanding children's hospital and evaluated fellows' perceptions of stigma around (and willingness to seek treatment for) psychological distress. The objectives are as follows: to (1) measure burnout among pediatric fellows, (2) assess fellows' perceptions of stigma around help seeking for mental illness, and (3) examine the relationship between burnout and willingness to seek behavioral health counseling.METHODS: We distributed a 48-item inventory to all 288 fellows in our pediatric center. Items included the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Likert-type matrices to assess attitudes toward behavioral health treatment and associated stigma. We used 2-sampled t-tests to associate burnout with willingness to seek mental health treatment.RESULTS: A total of 152 fellows (52%) responded, of whom 53% met the threshold for burnout. Most reported believing that their program directors (78%), attending physicians (72%), and patients (82%) hold negative attitudes about mental illness and its treatment; 68% believed that employers would reject their application if they knew they sought counseling. Fellows with burnout were more likely to believe that others in the clinical learning environment hold negative views of help seeking for behavioral health (odds ratio 1.2-1.9).CONCLUSIONS: Just over one-half of the pediatric fellows in our center meet the threshold for burnout. They also experience significant workplace-based stigma around help seeking for psychological distress. Fellows with burnout are more likely than their peers to perceive significant stigma around help seeking for their distress, making them a particularly at-risk learner population.",
