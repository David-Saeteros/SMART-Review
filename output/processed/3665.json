    "Abstract": "Introduction: Professionals working in emergency medical services frequently face intense physical and mental stress, significantly impacting their health and the quality of their work. Objective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of stress management strategies among Hungarian emergency medical service professionals and the available preventive measures. Method: The study is a cross-sectional investigation conducted between January 2023 and March 2024 in the Southern Transdanubian Region. The data of 202 emergency medical professionals were analyzed, including physiological parameters recorded at various time points (blood pressure, heart rate), the level of subjective stress perception, and cortisol values measured from saliva and hair samples. Mann-Whitney U test, chi 2 test, Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and repeated measures ANOVA were applied. Data processing was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0, G*Power 3.1, and Matplotlib 3.9.1 software. Results: Most participants work long shifts, often at night, and hold secondary jobs. Emergency departments experienced patient load five times that of prehospital settings, with more mentally demanding cases. Participants mainly rely on family, colleagues, and friends, but only a few seek the help of mental health professionals (7.4%). During emergencies, ambulance workers experienced a 10.7% increase in blood pressure, a 15.3% rise in heart rate, and a 1.7-fold increase in tension (p<0.001). In emergency departments, blood pressure increased by 8.5%, heart rate by 11.9%, and tension by 2.5-fold (p<0.001). The workplace environment and patient care processes in both settings elevated the cortisol levels of healthcare professionals (p<0.001). Hair sample measurements were higher among emergency department workers, reflecting the accumulation of long-term stress. Among ambulance workers, those serving at central stations exhibited higher cortisol levels than those at peripheral stations. Conclusion: Distress is significantly present among domestic emergency care professionals, particularly in work environments characterized by high patient volume and long shifts, posing long-term health risks. Mental health preservation and stress management practices must be integrated into daily routines, and communication efficiency should be improved through multichannel information and personal consultations. Systematic development of social support and workplace mental health services is essential to prevent chronic stress and burnout. Orv Hetil. 2025; 166(5): 183-194.",
