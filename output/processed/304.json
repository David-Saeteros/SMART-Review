    "Abstract": "The main purpose of this prospective study is to validate the construct of psychosocial well-being (PSWB) for people with severe mental disorders enrolled in Supported Employment (SE) programs. This paper also aims to assess the impact of job acquisition on PSWB after obtaining competitive employment. A two-phase study approach was used and 231 individuals with severe mental disorders enrolled in SE programs who took part in both phases. The shortened versions of the Psychological Well-Being Scale (Keyes et al. in J Personal Soc Psychol, 82(6):1007-1022, 2002; Ryff and Keyes in J Personal Soc Psychol 69(4):719-727, 1995) and the Social Well-Being Scale (Keyes in Soc Psychol Q 61(2):121-140, 1998) were used. The PSWB's multidimensionality construct was confirmed. The results of repeated measure ANOVA analyses revealed that job acquisition, as well as, being involved in a work-seeking process increase the PSWB of people with severe mental disorders. Employment specialists might find clinical utility in using this validated tool for assessing PSWB in their clients with severe mental disorders. In a recovery oriented approach to psychiatric services and SE programs, clinicians and employment specialists should continue to encourage their clients in their work integration process even though they may not all obtain competitive employment quickly.",
