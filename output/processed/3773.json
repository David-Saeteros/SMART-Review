    "Abstract": "PurposeBased on an approach to psychological health at work and on social exchange theory, this study tested the relationships between the four dimensions of organizational justice (distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational), supervisor and coworker support, resilience and psychological well-being (PWB).MethodUsing a cross-sectional design with one measurement, a sample of 369 French social workers responded to an online questionnaire. Analysis were based on correlations, and on mediations with Hayes and Preacher's (2014) method.ResultsThe results showed that satisfaction of the three psychological needs, procedural justice, supports, and resilience explained PWB. Mediation analyses showed that satisfaction of the need for autonomy played a mediating role between interpersonal justice, procedural justice, and PWB. Satisfaction of the needs for competence and autonomy played a mediating role between coworker support and PWB. Satisfaction of the three needs played a mediating role between resilience and PWB.Discussion and conclusionThe results pointed out the relevance of need satisfaction in predicting PWB. These findings confirm the relevance of justice, support, and resilience for social workers' well-being, and of the importance of need satisfaction that plays a critical role.",
