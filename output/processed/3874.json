    "Abstract": "The present study focused on the relationships between various aspects of self-regulated learning (SRL) and stress among undergraduate health science students in workplace settings. Although both constructs are associated with academic achievement (Ahmady Set al., in J Educ Health Promotion 10:32, 2021, Cho KK et al., in BMC Med Educ 17:112, 2017), it is still unclear how they influence each other. Employing a longitudinal diary design, the aim of the present study was to examine whether perceived stress in the previous week impacts SRL-aspects in the current week and, conversely, whether SRL-aspects in the previous week impacts stress in the current week. Subjects were 192 undergraduate health sciences students in their workplace placements. SRL-aspects and stress were assessed using scales and previously tested single-item measures. The 21 SRL-aspects used in this study included cognition (learning strategies), motivation, emotion, perception of the learning environment, and regulation of these areas on a metalevel (monitoring and control). Data collected over 15 weeks were analyzed using multilevel vector autoregressive models, with the data nested within weeks and one model dedicated to each SRL-aspect and its relationship with stress. Among the 21 path estimates assessing the impact of prior stress on individual SRL-aspects, 10 were statistically significant. For individual SRL-aspects impacting stress, 7 out of 21 paths were statistically significant (p < .05). Notably, no model showed statistical significance of effects in both directions. Except for two results, cross-lagged relationships were negative, indicating that better SRL-aspects from the previous week resulted in reduced stress in the current week and vice versa. The effects for the cross-lagged paths from SRL-aspects to stress were predominantly of medium size, whereas the influence of stress on individual SRL-aspects was predominantly small. The present study highlights a potentially causal and mostly negative relationship between stress and various aspects of SRL, but also that the individual relationships require differentiated consideration. The results can be used to develop targeted interventions in the practical part of the training of health science students to reduce stress and improve specific aspects of SRL. Furthermore, these findings underscore assumptions regarding connections between anxiety and increased stress, negative relationships between stress and motivation, and the importance of effective time management strategies for stress reduction.",
