    "Article Title": "How US college athletes manage COVID-19 related uncertainty",
    "Abstract": "Emerging adulthood is a period rife with uncertainty, even prior to COVID-19. Research suggests college athletes may be better adept at managing COVID-related challenges. Thus, we interviewed 16 U.S. college athletes to better understand their experiences related to uncertainty and uncertainty management. We found college athletes, who had to balance both academics and sports, experienced uncertainty related to health, academics, interpersonal relationships, and careers. Using the lens of uncertainty management theory (UMT), we found most college athletes viewed uncertainty negatively, attempting to reduce it via seeking social support and information, establishing schedules, and protecting against COVID. However, others learned to adapt to ambiguity by controlling what they could control and focusing on COVID's positives. By adapting, college athletes were able to build resilience, informing strategies other emerging adults can use not only to navigate a global pandemic, but the unexpected challenges and adversity inherent in emerging adulthood.",
