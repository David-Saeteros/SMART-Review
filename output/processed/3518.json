Employee well-being was compared with an independent sample of workers in the community. Results: Well-being and job performance increased and presenteeism and health risk decreased significantly over the 2 years. Employee well-being started lower and increased to exceed community worker averages, approaching significance. Well-being improvement was associated with higher productivity across all measures. Increases in employer support for well-being were associated with improved well-being and productivity. Conclusions: This employer's well-being strategy, including a culture supporting well-being, was associated with improved health and productivity.",
