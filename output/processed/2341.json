    "Article Title": "The impact of women?s off-farm employment on depressive symptoms: Evidence from rural China",
    "Abstract": "While China's economy has grown rapidly in recent decades, urban-rural inequalities in mental health have persisted, and depression is more prevalent among rural women. Using a nationally-representative survey data in China, this paper investigates the impact of women's off-farm employment on their depressive symptoms. Results from instrumental variable and individual fixed effects estimation show that women's participation in off-farm employment leads to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. We further take into account the con-founding effects of working conditions, and the main results are robust. Moreover, off-farm employment en-hances women's mental health mainly through pathways including increased absolute income, higher self -perceived relative income, more frequent healthy behaviors, increased likelihood of health investment, and obtaining more formal social support. Further evidence suggests that the depression-reducing effect of off-farm employment is more effective for those with more severe depressive symptoms, middle-aged and elderly persons, and women with lower body mass index. The findings have important implications for preventing depressive disorders and improving mental health in China and other developing countries.",
