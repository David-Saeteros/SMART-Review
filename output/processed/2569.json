    "Abstract": "Background: Sexual and gender minorities face high levels of stigma, discrimination, and violence. In many countries, they are often criminalized and are at risk of mental health challenges. In Zambia, little is known about the psychosocial challenges and coping strategies of sexual and gender minorities. This study sought to explore psychosocial challenges and coping strategies among sexual and gender minority populations in Lusaka, Zambia to inform mental health and human rights promotion for this population. Methods: The study used a qualitative phenomenological study design. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 16 sexual and gender minority participants (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) and four key informants. The sexual minorities included four lesbian, five gay, and three bisexual participants while the gender minorities included two transgender men and two transgender women. Interviews with gender and sexual minorities were mostly focused on the lived experiences of participants, while those of key informants focused on their work with sexual and gender minorities. Snowball strategy was used to recruit participants, while purposive sampling was used to select key informants. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was carried out with the aid of Nvivo 12 software. Results: Psychosocial challenges included victimization in the form of threats and physical assault. Stigma and discrimination were experienced in different settings such as healthcare, the workplace, and school. Participants reported having experienced feelings of depression. Rejection from family members was experienced by those who revealed their sexual or gender minority status. Reported coping strategies included social support, self-concealment, listening to music, and substance use. Conclusion: This study suggests that sexual and gender minorities in Zambia experience various psychosocial challenges related to their sexuality and gender identity. To assist them cope better with the obstacles they experience, improved psychosocial counseling and mental health services are needed.",
