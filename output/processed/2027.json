    "Abstract": "In schizophrenia employment rate is dramatically low, also among patients receiving job support interventions. Recent studies showed a direct relationship between neurocognitive deficits and work functioning, as well as proving the benefits of combined neurocognitive and work interventions. Current evidence also supports a role of Theory of Mind (ToM), on work functioning. However, the effect of integrated rehabilitation programmes including a social cognitive training on job outcome is still less explored. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the relationship between work competence and clinical factors, neurocognitive and ToM abilities, as well as to explore the effect of neurocognitive and ToM treatments combined with work therapy. Thirty-seven outpatients with schizophrenia were assigned to either a Computer-assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR) plus work therapy group (WTG) or to CACR and WTG added to ToM Intervention, both followed by a job support programme. All patients were assessed for psychopathology, neurocognition, ToM and work functioning. Work outcome was significantly predicted by age at onset, neurocognitive abilities and the degree of ToM improvement after the specific intervention. This study provides preliminary insight on predictors of work competence in schizophrenia, highlighting the importance of ToM abilities.",
