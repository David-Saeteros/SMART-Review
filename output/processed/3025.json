    "Article Title": "Predictors of acculturation attitudes among professional Chinese immigrants in the Australian workplace",
    "Abstract": "Professional Chinese immigrants ( PCIs) are expected to substantially contribute to the relief of skills shortage and the bolstering of Australia's economic and social development. However, they have encountered many adjustment difficulties arising from cultural and social differences after entering into the Australian workplace. There is a dearth of research to shed light on the adaptation of PCIs in Australia. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates PCIs ' acculturation preference and explores the predictors of each acculturation attitude. Our survey of a sample of 220 PCIs revealed that PCIs have a predominant preference to maintain their home culture, whereas logistic regressions revealed that length of residence in the host country, English proficiency, perceived social support at work and interdependent self-construal could predict the acculturation choices among PCIs. This study provides valuable information for managers and organizations in developing effective acculturation programs to assist immigrant employees with adaptation to a new workplace.",
