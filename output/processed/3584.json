    "Article Title": "Correlates of sedentary behaviour among adults with hazardous drinking habits in six low- and middle-income countries",
    "Abstract": "Sedentary behaviour is associated with poor mental health, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, all of which are a concern among hazardous drinkers. Little is known about sedentary behaviour and it's correlates in hazardous drinkers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We investigated correlates of sedentary behaviour among community-dwelling adults aged >= 18 years with hazardous drinking patterns in six low- and middle income countries. Cross-sectional data were analyzed from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. Hazardous drinking was defined as consuming > 7 (females) or > 14 (males) standard drinks per week. Associations between time spent sedentary and a range of correlates were examined using multivariable linear and logistic regression. The mean time spent sedentary in 2142 individuals with hazardous drinking patterns (mean age = 45.7 years; 13% female) was 216 +/- 135 min/day. Nine percent (95%Cl = 6.1-13.2%) were sedentary for >= 8 h per day. Living in an urban setting and unemployment were strong sociodemographic correlates of being sedentary for >= 8 h per day. From a health-related perspective, weak grip strength, stroke and disability were associated with increasing time spent sedentary. The current data provides important guidance for future interventions across low- and middle-income countries to assist hazardous drinkers to reduce sedentary behaviour.",
