The study self-administered included Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS), Organizational Support Perception Scale, Job Satisfaction Scale (JSS).RESULTS: In total, 260 people (mean age 38.17 +/- 14.9 years, 148 female) completed the survey. Extremely severe depression displayed on 39.9 %, extremely severe anxiety on 37.1%, and severe stress on 28.3% of the participants. Scores for depression (9.6 +/- 9.03), anxiety (7.2 +/- 7.04), stress (11.7 +/- 7.8) were also high for employees. It was observed that the average of organizational support score was 30.4 +/- 7.24, and the average job satisfaction score was 28.6 +/- 5.35. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between organizational support and job satisfaction (r = 0.562, p = 0.00). Considering the relationship between organizational support and DASS scale; there was negative correlation between (r =-0.161, p = 0.013). The results of the regression indicated that the model explained 32.9 % of the variance and that the model was a significant predictor, F (2,66)=117.145, p < 0.001.CONCLUSION: Organizational support are associated with a decline in mental health and job satisfaction. Health-promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintaining positive job organizational support-related behaviors should be utilized to address increases in psychological distress during the pandemic.",
