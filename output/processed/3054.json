    "Abstract": "BackgroundSince the inception of Counselling for Depression (CfD) in the UK as a competence-based training course for experienced therapists, there has been remarkably little empirical work exploring the experiences and views of trainees and those involved in course delivery.AimsThis qualitative study aimed to explore trainees', trainers' and supervisors' experiences of CfD training and their perceptions and understanding of competence in the context of CfD training and assessment.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were carried out with 19 participants recruited from two UK training courses and the BACP Practice Network. The interviews were analysed using Template Analysis.FindingsTwo key themes are reported here: tensions in the CfD competence model and tensions in CfD methods of training and assessment. Participants reported challenges in adapting to the CfD model. They felt that its use drew them away from core values in their practice so that they felt their identity as a therapist was threatened. In particular, they questioned the possibility of integrating person-centred and emotion-focussed approaches and felt that the directivity of emotion-focussed therapy was out of keeping with their core practice values. They also identified a number of difficulties with the CfD training and assessment; the training period was seen as an inadequate preparation for workplace practice, and the assessment process was criticised for being too narrow and was regarded as having little connection to the competence framework.ConclusionThe findings suggest a need for changes in policy and practice, specifically in regard to training and assessment.",
