    "Abstract": "Objective: To review the publications of a Total Worker Health Center (R) of Excellence, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being, in order to identify research findings relevant to either organizational or public policies. Methods: Two researchers independently reviewed 57 publications from 2011 to 2019 to identify cross-cutting themes that focus on working conditions or related health outcomes and their organizational and public policy implications. Results: Twelve cross-cutting themes were identified with their respective organizational and public policy implications. Several policy implications cut across work-related themes. Conclusions: Policy implications of TWH (R) research will aid in setting priorities to translate this from research into practice in future studies and help identify gaps that we and others can use to plan future TWH (R) research.",
