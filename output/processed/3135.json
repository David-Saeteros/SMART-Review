    "Article Title": "Job crafting by students who work and study",
    "Abstract": "Informed by a self-regulatory perspective, we tested a model (N = 233) in which job (e.g., autonomy), person (e.g., motivation), and study characteristics (e.g., engagement) predicted student job crafting, which, in turn, predicted work-study conflict and facilitation. Job, person, and study characteristics predicted task (46% of variance), cognitive (56%), and relational crafting (25%), and cognitive and relational crafting predicted greater work-study facilitation (53%). When students proactively modify their work environment, this is likely to assist them at work as well as facilitate their study life. Developing job crafting skills in students should improve both work and study functioning.",
