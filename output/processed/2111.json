    "Abstract": "Objective: Investigate feasibility and development of a linkage intervention to the evidence-based Individual Placement and Support (IPS) approach to supported employment (SE) for patients with schizophrenia on a mental health unit who want to work in competitive employment.Method: Literature review about the evidence-based IPS approach to SE in schizophrenia and why it might not be implemented in mental health services. Analysis of 10 adult mental health unit multidisciplinary staff interviews for categories in the literature review of IPS implementation barriers and whether these barriers could be overcome.Results: There was lack of full staff knowledge of the IPS approach to SE. However, all staff knew respect for patient choice was paramount, community employment programs existed for the disabled, an outreach linkage process to such a program and ongoing support for people with schizophrenia would be required. There was staff ambivalence about SE for patients with schizophrenia.Conclusion: Despite staff ambivalence about SE for people with schizophrenia there was still enough staff knowledge and openness to shape an IPS linkage intervention from a staff perspective.",
