    "Article Title": "Disparities in Lupus and the Role of Social Determinants of Health: Current State of Knowledge and Directions for Future Research",
    "Abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. The complex relationships between race and ethnicity and social determinants of health (SDOH) in influencing SLE and its course are increasingly appreciated. Multiple SDOH have been strongly associated with lupus incidence and outcomes and contribute to health disparities in lupus. Measures of socioeconomic status, including economic instability, poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity, as well as features of the neighborhood and built environment, including lack of safe and affordable housing, crime, stress, racial segregation, and discrimination, are associated with race and ethnicity in the US and are risk factors for poor outcomes in lupus. In this scientific statement, we aimed to summarize current evidence on the role of SDOH in relation to racial and ethnic disparities in SLE and SLE outcomes, primarily as experienced in the U.S. Lupus Foundation of America's Health Disparities Advisory Panel, comprising 10 health disparity experts, including academic researchers and patients, who met 12 times over the course of 18 months in assembling and reviewing the data for this study. Sources included articles published from 2011 to 2023 in PubMed, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, and bibliographies and recommendations. Search terms included lupus, race, ethnicity, and SDOH domains. Data were extracted and synthesized into this scientific statement. Poorer neighborhoods correlate with increased damage, reduced care, and stress-induced lupus flares. Large disparities in health care affordability, accessibility, and acceptability exist in the US, varying by region, insurance status, and racial and minority groups. Preliminary interventions targeted social support, depression, and shared-decision-making, but more research and intervention implementation and evaluation are needed. Disparities in lupus across racial and ethnic groups in the US are driven by SDOH, some of which are more easily remediable than others. A multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach involving various stakeholder groups is needed to address these complex challenges, address these diminish disparities, and improve outcomes.",
