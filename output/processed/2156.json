    "Abstract": "Background: Research has demonstrated that cognitive abilities predict work outcomes in people with psychosis. Cognitive Remediation Programs go some way in improving work outcomes, but individuals still experience difficulty maintaining employment. Metacognition has been demonstrated to predict work performance in individuals with schizophrenia, but this has not yet been applied to First Episode Psychosis (FEP). This study assessed whether metacognition, intellectual aptitude and functional capacity can predict engagement in work and number of hours of work within FEP.Methods: Fifty-two individuals with psychosis, from an Early Intervention in Psychosis service, completed measures of IQ, metacognition (Metacognitive Assessment Interview), functional capacity (UPSA), and functional outcome (hours spent in structured activity per week, including employment).Results: Twenty-six participants (22 males, 4 females) were employed and twenty-six (22 males, 4 females) were not employed. IQ and metacognition were significantly associated with whether the individual was engaged in employment [IQ (p = .02) and metacognition (p = 006)]. When controlling for IQ, metacognition (differentiation subscale) remained significant (p = .04). Next, including only those employed, no cognitive nor metacognitive factors predicted number of hours in employment.Discussion: This is the first study to directly assess metacognition as a predictor of work hours for individuals with FEP. This study highlights the importance of enhancing metacognitive ability in order to improve likelihood of, and engagement in, employment for those with FEP.",
