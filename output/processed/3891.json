    "Article Title": "Clinical features and impact of myasthenia gravis disease in Australian patients",
    "Abstract": "We performed a community-based survey of 165 Australian patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction causing fatiguable muscle weakness. Patients with early onset MG (<40 years of age) were more frequently female (22 males, 60 females) whereas patients with late onset MG (>40 years of age) were more frequently male (50 males, 28 females; p <0.001). Triggering and exacerbating factors included physical and emotional stress, infections, surgery or trauma, seasonal changes and medications. The co-occurrence of other immune-related diseases was reported by 54% of patients. The median MG quality of life (QOL) score was 92 (range: 24-186). The factor most strongly associated with poor QOL was depression. Only 40.6% of patients were working at the time of the survey and of these, almost half had required sick leave due to MG in the past 12 months. A further 39.4% had stopped work due to MG and 19.4% having to change occupation. Full-time or part-time care was required by 29% of patients and government financial support was received by 52.7%.
