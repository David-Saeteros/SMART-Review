    "Abstract": "This is a secondary data analysis exploring adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in persons living with HIV (PLWH) with a comorbid mental health disorder. Logistic regression analyses indicated that PLWH who had reliable housing were over six times more adherent than those with unreliable housing. Descriptive odds ratio analyses showed directional relationships for ART adherence with coping, employment, and social support. These results indicate areas for future investigation in PLWH and comorbid mental health disorders, and the potential to find ways to foster certain emotional or living conditions that promote ART adherence.",
