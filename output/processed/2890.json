    "Article Title": "Peer Support Providers' Role Experiences on Interprofessional Mental Health Care Teams: A Qualitative Study",
    "Abstract": "This study explores how peer support providers' roles are defined and integrated in inter-professional mental health care teams, and how these providers relate to other practitioners and clients. Interviews were conducted with peer support providers in two different formal models of peer support employment. Qualitative data analysis was undertaken. The findings indicate that: peer support providers experience ambiguity and that some ambiguity may offer benefits; peer support providers enhance team acceptance of their role through several means and strategies; setting boundaries with clients is a delicate issue that requires several considerations that we discuss.",
