    "Article Title": "Well-being of newly diagnosed women with breast cancer: which factors matter more?",
    "Abstract": "The assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients is necessary to address predictive factors in supportive clinical practice.The objectives of this study are to evaluate self-reported HRQL within 1 year after breast cancer diagnosis and to determine important factors associated with self-reported impaired HRQL.A cross-sectional study was performed in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. The statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and stepwise logistic regression modeling.The survey response rate was 67 % (n = 338). Almost 50 % of the studied population was identified as experiencing anxiety. The impaired HRQL domains were emotional functioning and global health status. Severely expressed symptoms included insomnia, fatigue, and financial difficulties. Poor financial situation, comorbidities, unemployment, and lack of psychological counseling were identified as important predictive factors (p < 0.001).Psychosocial, but not clinical, factors were the prevalent predictive factors in impaired HRQL. Early identification of women that are at risk of poorer HRQL and interventions of psychosocial support following breast cancer diagnosis are recommended.",
