    "Article Title": "A Content Analysis of Literature on Trans People and Issues: 2002-2012",
    "Abstract": "This study provides a content analysis of more than a decade (2002-2012) of academic scholarship about trans people and issues. A total of 960 trans-focused publications were coded; there was a close balance of nonempirical (54%) and empirical (46%) publications. The analyses revealed that the literature on trans people and issues is growing, although many publications include trans people and issues nominally without substantive attention. The analyses also pointed to underutilized research designs and methodologies, the need for more clear assessment and more consistent reporting of demographic characteristics, and topics that warrant further attention. Specifically, literature on trans people and issues continues to be needed on the topics of focus thus far, such as psychological and identity-related distress. Scholarship is also needed to address important topics that have been understudied, including self-harm and suicide, positive functioning and mental health promoting factors, developmental issues across the life span, school and workplace experiences, and the training and competencies of health care providers to ensure affirmative and effective services for trans people.",
