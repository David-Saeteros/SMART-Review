    "Abstract": "IntroductionThe long-term impact of COVID-19 on mental health, particularly in relation to socio-economic vulnerabilities, has received little attention. This study reports the prevalence of mental health-related symptoms among previously hospitalized patients after recovery from COVID-19, and its association with socio-economic status (SES). MethodsData collection of this cross-sectional study was conducted during February-April 2021, among previously hospitalized patients with COVID-19 like symptoms, on average six months after their discharge from the hospital. Using DASS-21, a validated scale to document symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, information on mental health-related symptoms were recorded from 481 respondents along with sociodemographic and economic information through telephone interviews. Chi-square tests were performed to identify significant group differences. Multinomial logistic regression analyzed the association between the changes in socioeconomic characteristics and mental health-related symptoms. Relative index of inequality (RII), slope index of inequality (SII), and concentration index (CIX) were applied to capture relevant inequalities in relation to mental health-related symptoms. ResultsEleven percent of the respondents reported changes in employment status, nearly half changes in income and expenditure. Forty-five percent reported symptoms of depression, anxiety and/or stress, and 12% reported coexistence of all three symptoms. Women [Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR: 2.95; 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.39-5.68], and those who reported changes in occupation [AOR: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.01-9.08] and expenditure [AOR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.12-5.37] were more likely to report all three mental health-related symptoms compared to men and those without changes in occupation and expenditure. The older age group was less likely [AOR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.93-0.99] to report coexistence of all three symptoms compared to their younger counterparts. Negative values of concentration index (CIX) indicate that any one mental health-related symptom was significantly concentrated among those with lower expenditure and poor SES. ConclusionThis study will help in addressing mental health-related challenges after recovery from COVID-19 among the identified vulnerable groups through relevant community-based and clinical response, including counseling services, in Bangladesh and similar LMIC contexts.",
