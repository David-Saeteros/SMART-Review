    "Article Title": "Working after incarceration: An integrative framework of pre- and post-hire experiences of formerly incarcerated individuals",
    "Abstract": "In this paper, we review literature that examines employment outcomes for people with histories of incarceration. Previous research on formerly incarcerated individuals (FIIs) has highlighted almost exclusively the implications of the selection process and their stigmatization. The current paper provides insight on the experiences of FIIs navigating stigma during the job search process and while at work. Using 136 articles published from 2012 to 2022, we seek to offer a theoretical framework synthesizing and integrating research from several disciplines. First, we model the process of applying for and maintaining employment, from both the applicant's and employers' perspectives. Second, we identify key moderators at the individual and contextual level that in-fluence FIIs' pre-and post-employment experiences. Third, we highlight significant knowledge gaps that are especially salient for human resource management scholars and propose future research directions. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of contributions to theory and research and practical implications.",
