    "Article Title": "Exploring Predictors of Service Use Among Youth Experiencing Homelessness",
    "Abstract": "Objective: Given the high prevalence of Black youth experiencing homelessness, this study sought to understand if race impacts service use and whether other marginalized identities (e.g., gender, sexual orientation) are associated with unique service patterns among youth experiencing homelessness. Method: We used data collected from 1,046 homeless youth (ages 13-24) in Los Angeles County, CA, between October 2011 and June 2013. We used classification tree analyses to rank predictors of service use in order of importance and to test linear and nonlinear relationships among selected variables. Results: Across service type (i.e., shelter, therapy, employment, or health services), the classification tree analyses highlighted race as a primary predictor of service use. Conclusions: Critical race theory may be a useful framework for future explorations of service use among Black youth experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, as race consistently emerges as a feature of importance, providers should consider how race impacts service use.",
