    "Abstract": "Objectives. Improving subjective well-being (SWB) for people with mental health problems is a United Kingdom national health priority and is increasingly important in justifying funding of mental health services. Aside from the economic advantages, maximizing SWB confers obvious individual and clinical benefits for people with severe mental illness, such as psychosis. Gaining a better understanding of well-being and its determinants will enable current evidence-based interventions to be targeted and refined appropriately. This study therefore sought to identify the cross-sectional correlates of SWB in an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies for people with Severe Mental Illness psychosis demonstration site, to inform a future longitudinal investigation.Methods. Participants with a psychosis or bipolar spectrum diagnosis referred to the demonstration site (n = 410) rated SWB as part of their initial assessment before starting psychological therapy. Potential influencing factors including age, gender, ethnicity, employment status, illness duration, perceived social support, perceived coping, and psychotic symptoms (voices and beliefs) were also assessed.Results. Regression analyses showed that unemployment (beta = -.16, p < .001), lack of social support (beta = -.20, p < .001), distressing beliefs (beta = -.12, p = .004), and poorer coping (beta = -.43, p < .001) were associated with reduced SWB, together accounting for 43% of the variance in well-being, F(5, 392) = 58.42, p < .001; mean SWB = 39.09, SD = 11.61.Conclusions. This study provides preliminary insights into the determinants of SWB in a large sample of people with psychosis. Improving employability, social interactions, coping strategies, and psychotic symptoms may improve SWB. Further longitudinal investigation will determine the potential value of preferentially targeting these areas in therapy to meet national requirements to prioritize well-being outcomes.",
