    "Abstract": "ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to provide evidence of the acceptability of the primary care psychology services that have been enhanced by the employment of assistant psychologists in Ireland to the parents of children with psychological difficulties.MethodData were collected from a sample of 74 parents who responded to quantitative and qualitative questions on the experience of service questionnaire. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the questionnaire responses.ResultsOn average 88% of participants selected 'certainly true' in response to the statements in the experience of service questionnaire statement they were 'Totally satisfied'. Three major themes were developed; 'communication is more than talking', 'structure can facilitate or impede', and 'emotional reactions'. 'Communication is more than talking' is organised around communication The 'structure can facilitate or impede' acknowledges that systems influence psychological supports. 'Emotional reactions' captured parents' experiences, such as joy, frustration, and solidarity.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that the newly enhanced mental health service is acceptable to parents. Their voices provide ideas about what helps and hinders their experience of care.",
