    "Article Title": "The role of social support in suicidal ideation: a comparison of employed vs. unemployed people",
    "Abstract": "Background: With the financial crisis, the number of unemployed has grown up, and so has suicidal ideation in these individuals. Although extensive research has been done about the factors associated with it, studies about protective factors are also necessary. Aims: To examine the relationship between unemployment and suicidal ideation, and the protective effect of social support. Methods: Participants were 149 people in full-time employment (age M = 41.63, SD = 10.37), 55 unemployed (M = 42.25, SD = 10.23 years), and 32.72 months average unemployment time (SD = 26.13). Instruments were a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) and the Social Support Appraisal (SSA). Results: Suicidal ideation was significantly higher in the unemployed group, and positively associated with duration of unemployment. Social support, both from family and friends, was found to be a protective factor in suicidal ideation, particularly in long-term unemployment. Limitations: Cross-sectional study, convenience sample. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is markedly present in unemployed individuals, particularly those unemployed for a year or more, and social support from family and friends may act as a significant protective factor.",
