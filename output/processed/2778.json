    "Abstract": "This study examines the effects of cyber- and traditional workplace bullying, organizational justice, and social support on psychological distress. Using a cross-sectional design, we submitted an on-line questionnaire to 179 French civil servants. Based on Hayes and Preacher's (2014) method, the results indicated that organizational justice as a whole and, specifically, interpersonal justice, were a partial mediator in the relationship between traditional bullying and psychological distress. Supervisor support was a partial mediator in the relationship between traditional bullying and psychological distress, and, a complete mediator within the relationship between cyberbullying and psychological stress. The inclusion of organizational justice as a mediator provided an interesting route, suggesting that it is essential to prevent the harmful consequences of bullying. Communication, respectful relationships, and above all support from supervisors are essential solutions for decreasing psychological distress at work.",
