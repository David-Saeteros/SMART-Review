    "Abstract": "Many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) workers face discrimination in the workplace. What forms does this take and what is the degree of discrimination experienced by LGBT persons? Sexual identity management and other coping strategies in the face of potential or encountered discrimination raise various issues for LGBT persons. How might these issues influence LGBT persons' responses to discrimination? And what are the implications for policy advocacy and career counselling?",
