    "Article Title": "The Impact of COVID-19 on Clubhouse Employment Programs",
    "Abstract": "The Clubhouse model of psychosocial rehabilitation provides several employment opportunities to individuals who experience mental health concerns, including transitional, supported, and independent employment. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Clubhouses having to adapt existing programs to online formats. Employment programs were further impacted, as many workplaces in the community closed or reduced capacity. The present study aimed to examine the rates of involvement in transitional, supported, and independent employment across six Clubhouses in Canada throughout the pandemic. 462 members completed surveys at five time points pertaining to participation in Clubhouse employment programs. The data was analyzed using Cochran's Q tests to determine differences in employment rates across time points. The results demonstrated an overall decrease in transitional and supported employment rates throughout the pandemic. Conversely, rates of independent employment were unchanged. It is evident that Clubhouse employment programs assist members in obtaining employment. The results suggest Clubhouses may benefit from exploring novel employment opportunities to support their members, such as remote work.",
