    "Article Title": "Clients' Preferences for Family Involvement and Subsequent Family Contact Patterns Within OnTrackNY Early Psychosis Services",
    "Abstract": "Objective: Little is known about clients' preferences for family involvement and subsequent family contact in naturalistic, community-based coordinated specialty care (CSC) settings. The study's primary goal was to characterize clients' preferences and longitudinal patterns of family contact with providers across the OnTrackNY network in New York.Methods: Clinical administrative data collected at 3-month intervals and spanning 21 OnTrackNY CSC sites were used to analyze the preferences of 761 clients at baseline (unconditional involvement, conditional involvement, or no involvement) and patterns of family contact with program staff (always, sometimes, never, or early discharge) and their correlates during the initial 12-month service period. Data from clients discharged before 12 months were included for comparison.Results: At baseline, most clients requested some form of family involvement (unconditional, 59%; conditional, 35%; and none, 6%). Within each 3-month assessment period, rates of family contact ranged from 73% to 84%. Variables associated with both client preferences and contact patterns included baseline insurance status, housing status, race, frequency of family contact, and employment. Clients' preferences for no or conditional family involvement were associated with higher rates of early discharge (i.e., before 1 year).Conclusions: Structuring family involvement around clients' preferences did not appear to negatively affect family contact, and for some clients, it seemed to bolster such contact. Additional mixed-methods research is needed to deepen the understanding of the contexts and reasoning underlying both client preferences for family involvement and subsequent levels of family contact.",
