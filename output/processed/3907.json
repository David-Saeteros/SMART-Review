    "Abstract": "Despite significant advances in antiretroviral therapy, unmet basic needs can negatively impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people living with HIV, especially as they age. We aimed to examine the effect of unmet basic needs across age groups on changes in HRQoL over a 4-year period in persons with HIV. Physical and mental HRQoL scores from the Positive Spaces, Healthy Spaces cohort interviewed in 2006 (n = 538), 2007 (n = 506), and 2009 (n = 406) were examined across three age groups according to their unmet needs for food, clothing, and housing. Individual growth curve model analyses were used to investigate changes over time, adjusting for demographics, employment, living conditions, social supports, HIV status, and health behavior risks. Low scores on physical and mental HRQoL were positively associated with higher number of unmet basic needs (beta = -6.40, standard error (SE) = 0.87, p < 0.001 and beta = -7.39, SE = 1.00, p < 0.001, respectively). There was a slight improvement in physical and mental HRQoL over 4 years in this HIV cohort, but the burden of unmet basic needs took its toll on those over 50 years of age. Regularly assessing unmet basic needs is recommended given the impact these can have on HRQOL for people living with HIV. Recognition of unmet needs is vital, as is the development of timely interventions.",
