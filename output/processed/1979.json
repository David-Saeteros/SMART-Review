    "Abstract": "Objectives: Supported employment (SE) was introduced to Switzerland in 2002. Since then, an increasing number of SE programs have been launched across Switzerland. This article reviews the state of SE in Switzerland. Method: Several Individual Placement and Support (IPS-SE) studies have been conducted in Switzerland. We reviewed the implementation. results, and possible future developments related to all Swiss IPS-SE studies. Findings: Studies have demonstrated that IPS-SE programs can be successfully implemented with excellent results in Switzerland, but most vocational rehabilitation programs do not provide SE. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: While SE is becoming the first choice for vocational rehabilitation in Switzerland, development and potential improvements are underway.",
