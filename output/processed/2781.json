    "Article Title": "Life Satisfaction and Psychological Distress of African Immigrants in Italy and Spain: The Protective Hole of Social Support and Sense of Community",
    "Abstract": "This article analyzes whether migrants' distress factors are reduced, and life satisfaction increased by the sense of community and support from friendship or family networks, with age and length of residence serving as co-variables. Host country, gender, migration (economic/non-economic), employment (employed/unemployed) and legal status (regulated/unregulated) were all treated as moderating variables. We tested this theoretical model in two samples of African immigrants residing in Palermo (Italy) and Malaga (Spain), confirming the predictive capacity of the independent variables. Interesting results emerged relating to the effects of length of residence, employment status and support from immigrant friends.",
