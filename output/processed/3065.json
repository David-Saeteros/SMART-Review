    "Article Title": "Vet - a 'dream job'? Survey of work-related satisfaction and possible emotional stressors of veterinarians in a university setting",
    "Abstract": "Veterinary medicine is regarded as a rewarding profession by many students and veterinarians but in working life emotional factors might lead to disillusion and compromised enthusiasm and might even cause severe health problems. To investigate workrelated aspects, both positive and negative, the occupational satisfaction and emotional stressors of veterinarians working in a university setting were surveyed. Fifty-five volunteers completed survey sheets that consisted of 31 questions. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.17. A p-value of <0.05 was considered as significant. Analysis showed that love of animals, medical interest and the desire to help animals are important factors in choosing this profession. Although various workplace-related factors have a negative impact on the emotional well-being of the respondents, over 95% would choose the job again. Over 70% of participants knew at least one colleague who had taken his life, underlining the high suicide risk of the profession. Helping animals, having an interesting job, interaction with colleagues and lifelong learning were rated as positive sides of being a veterinarian working in a university setting. Despite great odds, being a veterinarian can be a profoundly fulfilling profession. However, it is advisable to inform prospective students better about the high emotional burden the job can impose, compounding the problems caused by long working hours and a low income. Veterinary medicine is more than a profession: it is a calling and the choice of the job should be well considered. Appropriate training of veterinary students and the availability of counselling services for veterinarians would be desirable.",
