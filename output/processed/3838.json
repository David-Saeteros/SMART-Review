    "Article Title": "Associations of Partner Support and Acculturation With Physical Activity in Mexican American Women",
    "Abstract": "Introduction:Insufficient physical activity (PA) and obesity-related health conditions have reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Mexican American women (MAW) report low leisure time physical activity. Few studies examine activities beyond leisure time. Qualitative research suggests that partner support influence provides a cultural approach relevant to PA among MAW. Method:This cross-sectional study used an ecological model to investigate community (the physical environment), interpersonal (partner support, attitudinal familism), and intrapersonal (age, health conditions, acculturation, employment, and body mass index) factors associated with PA among 112 MAW. Community-based participatory research recommendations guided the preparatory phase of the study and the face-to-face interviews. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were computed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between study variables. Results:Moderate to high PA levels were found based on combined activities performed during leisure time, transportation, household tasks, and occupational duties. Women with greater partner support reported higher PA levels. Although acculturation levels were low among women, those with higher acculturation were found to be more physically active. Conclusions:Future studies should examine strategies to increase partner support and address acculturation within intervention programs to enhance overall PA among MAW.",
