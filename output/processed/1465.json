    "Abstract": "Objectives and Methods: A cross sectional study of HCPs working in public MCH clinics in Assiut city was conducted to explore their knowledge, attitudes and counselling practices regarding prevention of SHS exposure among pregnant women and children. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed.Results: 367 HCPs participated in the study, 12% of whom were smokers. The majority were nurses (45%). A considerable proportion of HCPs reported being exposed to SHS in workplace (70%) and home (52%). About half HCP reported high SHS knowledge (56%), supportive attitude towards preventing SHS exposure (53%), and having good counselling practice regarding SHS exposure (52%). Being a GP and serving urban communities were significantly associated with high knowledge. Being female, serving a rural population, receiving training on smoking cessation services, not being exposed to SHS at home, and having a supportive attitude towards prevention of SHS exposure were significantly associated with good counselling practice.Conclusion: Awareness, attitudes and counselling practice of HCPs should be improved. Training for HCPs and enforcement of smoke free polices are needed to improve awareness and facilitate changes in social norms.",
