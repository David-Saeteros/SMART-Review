    "Article Title": "'I am Still Able to Contribute to Someone Less Fortunate': A Phenomenological Analysis of Young Adults' Process of Personal Healing from Major Depression",
    "Abstract": "Understanding depression can be important in increasing young adults' willingness to seek professional mental healthcare. This study examined young adults' experiences of recovery from depression from a subjective stance. Using transcendental phenomenological design, the authors studied the experiences of nine Malaysian young adults who reported experiences of recovery from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Data collected through audio-recorded, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, were analysed using Colaizzi's (1978) descriptive phenomenological approach. Six interconnected emerging themes addressing personal healing contributors were revealed: supportive relationships; medication; attending counselling; religion and spirituality; care for others; and employment. Each major theme was supported by three subthemes. A combination of factors generated greater personal healing experiences. This study highlighted how practitioners could help young adults in their recovery from depression.",
