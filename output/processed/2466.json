    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: No studies have examined vocational identity among individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders.OBJECTIVE: Influenced by Blustein's relational theory of working (2011), this study examined the relationships between several social-environmental variables (external/relational conflicts, employment barriers, substance abuse stigma) and vocational identity.METHODS: Eighty-four veterans receiving treatment from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders participated in this survey study.RESULTS: Education, employment, clinical, disability, and substance abuse factors were not associated with vocational identity, but external/relational conflicts, employment barriers, and substance abuse stigma were. Multiple regression analysis found that these variables accounted for 34% of the variance in vocational identity and that external/relational conflicts was the only significant predictor.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that more conflictual messages about work from external/relational sources is related to less clarity around one's vocational interests, goals, and talents.",
