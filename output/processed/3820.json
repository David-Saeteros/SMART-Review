    "Abstract": "Introduction: ss-Thalassemia, a genetic condition which influences both the physical and emotional facets of individuals specially females while also exerting substantial financial strain on families and healthcare systems. Recognizing the pivotal influence of social support, particularly on mental well-being, this study endeavors to delve into the shared psychosocial challenges experienced by females grappling with ss-thalassemia major. Methods: Employing a qualitative-descriptive methodology and purposive sampling, this study conducted in-depth interviews with forty-two young girls, 18.64 +/- 4.27, diagnosed with ss-thalassemia major and representing diverse academic backgrounds, using a semi-structured in-depth interview guide. NVIVO-12 software facilitated extended data analysis, encompassing coding, categorization, theme development, and mind-mapping techniques to unravel nuanced insights from the collected data. Findings: This groundbreaking study delves into the psychosocial factors that impact the well-being of female ss-thalassemia patients. The research highlights the key factors that positively contribute to their quality of life by conducting thorough inductive content analysis. These include receiving an education, having robust family support, experiencing overall life satisfaction, and making meaningful societal contributions. The findings of this study can be used to improve the lives of female ss-thalassemia patients and enhance their overall well-being. Contrariwise, notable impediments encompassed depression, social isolation, limited access to insurance services, challenges in educational and employment spheres, as well as difficulties in nurturing social relationships. These findings underscore the multifaceted influences shaping the quality of life for girls navigating ss-thalassemia, shedding light on empowering and challenging elements within their experiences. Conclusion: In conclusion, psychosocial factors supporting or hindering the well-being of young girls with ss-thalassemia major in Pakistan include an inductive environment at homes, organizations, education, institutions with adequate knowledge of thalassemia disease among patients, and society. More research is needed to understand their needs and advocate for societal support and acceptance. Family and friends support are crucial for improving their quality of life, necessitating focused efforts to provide understanding and aid within the community.
