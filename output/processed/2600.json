    "Abstract": "Background: Marijuana as an alternative treatment for chronic illnesses has gained popularity over the past several years, and researchers continue to report positive outcomes for a growing number of disorders.Objective: To address the increasing number of individuals with disabilities using medicinal marijuana, this study sought to ascertain how rehabilitation professionals (RPs) respond when working with individuals who use this form of treatment. for chronic health conditions.Methods: RPs were presented with two case scenarios depicting clients who were either currently using or considering using marijuana and were asked what steps they would take when working with this individual. Options included (a) dismiss the client; (b) counsel the client against using; (c) refer client to a mental health professional; (d) meet with the employer; (e) consult with the physician who would recommend medical marijuana for your client; (f) consult your supervisor; (g) consult your agency's policy on drug use; and (h) review the code of ethics for your profession.Findings: No significant results were noted in scenario 1, however, participants were more likely to consult those who could increase their understanding of medicinal marijuana and those who could help support their work with these clients In scenario 2, participants were significantly more likely to select meeting with the clients' employer, which speaks to the primary focus of RPs' work-helping clients obtain and maintain employment.Conclusion: There are far reaching implications for our work as RPs, including serving as valuable resources for clients who do not typically seek out vocational rehabilitation services.",
