    "Article Title": "Intervention outcome preferences for youth who are out of work and out of school: a qualitative study",
    "Abstract": "Background While interventions have been developed and tested to help youth who have become disconnected from work and school, there is a paucity of research on young people's intervention preferences. This study aims to understand young people's preferred intervention outcomes and approaches for youth who are out of work and school. Methods Thirty youth participated in virtual focus groups. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Youth want interventions and approaches that support them in (1) vocational readiness, (2) securing a job, and (3) mental health and well-being, while providing them with (4) high-contact, individualized, and integrated support. Conclusions Young people want interventions to be individualized and integrated, providing a high level of support for their educational and employment pursuits as well as their mental health and well-being. Incorporating youth's perspectives when designing interventions can increase intervention relevance and potentially service uptake, helping youth continue to pursue their educational and vocational goals.",
