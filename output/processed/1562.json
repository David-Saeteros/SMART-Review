    "Abstract": "Background The climate crisis is increasingly leading to negative consequences for mental health and is of growing importance for psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care. ObjectiveThe effects of the climate crisis on mental health and its significance for psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care are presented. Recommendations for sustainability in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic practice are provided. Material and methods A narrative review of the literature was conducted for this article. Results The climate crisis has direct, indirect and intersectional negative effects on mental health. Sustainable and preventive recommendations for the practice include promoting health literacy, faster access to psychotherapy and online counselling, supporting social networks, promoting employment and reducing poverty, homelessness and social isolation. It is recommended to increase the proportion of outpatient care and to streamline administrative processes. The use of disposable products should be minimized and the application of instrumental diagnostics and materials should be optimized according to guidelines. Digital interventions should be considered more frequently in the clinical practice and sustainable facility management should be improved. Access to green spaces for the general population and patients should be facilitated. Conclusion Due to the negative impact of the climate crisis on mental health, sustainability should be promoted in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care.",
