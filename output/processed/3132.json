    "Abstract": "Clinical Impact Statement This study highlights the importance of developing effective and secure means of communication with colleagues in the office when home-working with traumatic material cannot be avoided, dedicated time and technological solutions to promote belonging and community, and strategies to help home-workers in mentally separating work and home space, despite both occurring in the same physical space when working with trauma-related material.Objective: During the present pandemic, emerging literature argues that front-line officers' mental health is at greater risk while performing their duties. However, little is known of the impact on the work of professionals in analytical/intelligence roles in police, law enforcement, and justice organizations. Therefore, this study explored the impact of the current pandemic on the experiences of analysts working in these roles. Method: Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with these analysts and template analysis was used to analyze the transcriptions. Results: Nine themes were identified namely A new safe workplace, Opportunity to catch up, Communication delays, Discomfort with commuting, Facilitating offending, Isolation, Loss of social support, Insufficient technical resources, and Work-life imbalance. Conclusion: Analysts when home-working with traumatic material were facing challenges, such as limited human interaction and no immediate support from employers, which were causing psychological distress during these unprecedented times. While the nature of their work puts some constraints on what can be done to support these analysts, some suggestions are made, which employers could action.",
