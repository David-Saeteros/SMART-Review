    "Article Title": "Health-related Quality of Life of Older Women Religious: Negative Influence of Frailty",
    "Abstract": "The purpose of the current study was to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of older women religious (WR) and examine variables that may influence HRQOL. The sample consisted of WR, 65 years or older, living in the Cleveland Catholic Diocese. The participants completed a medical history, body-mass index (BMI) and blood pressure measurement, and self-report measures of HRQOL, frailty, social support, resilience, and depression. The study sample was composed of 108 older WR with a mean age of 75.6 (range 65-93 years). The women reported high levels of daily functioning, resilience, and social support, with low levels of depression. WR describe a relatively high level of HRQOL. Frailty was an independent negative predictor of HRQOL in all subscales except general health. Resilience and fear of falling had significant effects on several HRQOL subscales.",
