    "Abstract": "Background Work-family imbalance is a crucial determinant of workers' health. Studies examining the impact of multiple roles in the workplace, conducted in low- and middle-income countries, are limited. Aims To determine the association of work-family imbalance with self-perceived health (SPH) both in men and women, and to examine the interaction of social support with work-family imbalance on this association in a district in western Turkey. Methods This population-based cross-sectional study's sample was randomly derived from working residents aged 30-64 living in Balcova District, Turkey. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted for the associations between SPH, social support at home and at work, work-family conflict (WFC) and family-work conflict (FWC). Social support variables were considered as possible effect modifiers. Results Work to family variables had an independent, significant association with poor SPH [odds ratio (OR) = 2.92 (95% CI 1.47-5.78) for WFC, and 2.38 (95% CI 1.22-4.67) for FWC] in only women. In advanced analyses, both social support at work and at home were effect modifiers of the association between FWC and SPH in women (P < 0.001). In men, SPH was significantly associated only with job insecurity [OR = 2.52 (1.22-5.21)]. Conclusions Further studies should be conducted to implement effective population prevention strategies to establish work-family balance and to reduce this double burden on women, specifically in low- and middle-income countries.Our knowledge regarding the impact of multiple roles in the workplace in low- and middle-income countries is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of work-family imbalance and the importance of social support on health in a district in western Turkey. Our study showed that work-family conflict was a crucial determinant of health only in women, and having adequate social support diminished the detrimental effects of this double burden on women.",
