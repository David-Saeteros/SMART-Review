    "Abstract": "Purpose of ReviewPharmacological therapy for acute pain carries the risk of opioid misuse, with opioid use disorder (OUD) reaching epidemic proportions worldwide in recent years. This narrative review covers the latest research on patient risk factors for opioid misuse in the treatment of acute pain. In particular, we emphasize newer findings and evidence-based strategies to reduce the prevalence of OUD.Recent FindingsThis narrative review captures a subset of recent advances in the field targeting the literature on patients' risk factors for OUD in the treatment for acute pain. Besides well-recognized risk factors such as younger age, male sex, lower socioeconomic status, White race, psychiatric comorbidities, and prior substance use, additional challenges such as COVID-19 further aggravated the opioid crisis due to associated stress, unemployment, loneliness, or depression.To reduce OUD, providers should evaluate both the individual patient's risk factors and preferences for adequate timing and dosing of opioid prescriptions. Short-term prescription should be considered and patients at-risk closely monitored. The integration of non-opioid analgesics and regional anesthesia to create multimodal, personalized analgesic plans is important. In the management of acute pain, routine prescription of long-acting opioids should be avoided, with implementation of a close monitoring and cessation plan.",
