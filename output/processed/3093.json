    "Article Title": "The stigma of being a refugee: A mixed-method study of refugees' experiences of vocational stress",
    "Abstract": "This concurrent embedded mixed-method study examined vocational stressors and coping mechanisms among refugees. Results from a content analysis of open-ended surveys collected from 159 refugees show that the most frequently reported refugee vocational stressor was access and opportunity (31% of comments made about vocational stressors). This meta-theme encompasses feeling as though past work experience is discounted in the job search, struggles with the job search, and exploitation (e.g., low pay). Other meta-themes included acculturative, discrimination, interpersonal, financial and personal vocational stressors. Qualitative accounts of coping revealed reflection and relaxation (25%) and problem-solving actions (24%) as the most commonly reported coping mechanisms. In addition, refugee-specific coping mechanisms (17%) were frequently reported, and referred to building language skills, engaging in assimilation and multicultural activities, and seeking social support from other refugees. Using the meta-themes that emerged in each vocational stressor category, t-test results show that the experience of discrimination stressors was related to higher levels of self-reported anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. In addition, the use of avoidance-oriented coping mechanisms was associated with maladaptive outcomes, such as depression, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Taken together, our results indicate that refugees face many of the vocational stressors typically studied in the occupational health literature (e.g., underemployment). The current study also uncovered unique vocational stressors and coping mechanisms, including evidence for a refugee-specific stigma experienced during the job search process and among refugees who are currently employed. Recommendations for theoretical implications and future research on refugee vocational stressors and coping mechanisms are discussed.",
