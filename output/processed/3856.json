    "Abstract": "Background: People with MS (pwMS) commonly experience a range of hidden symptoms, including cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression, fatigue, pain, and sensory difficulties. These invisible symptoms can significantly impact wellbeing, relationships, employment and life goals. We developed a novel bespoke online group neuropsychological intervention combining psychoeducation and cognitive rehabilitation with an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-informed approach for pwMS in an acute tertiary hospital. This 'Neuropsychological Intervention for Managing Invisible Symptoms' in MS (NIMIS-MS) consisted of 6 sessions, each with a psychoeducation and ACT component. The content included psychoeducation around managing cognitive difficulties, fatigue, pain, sleep and other unpleasant sensations in MS with the general approach of understanding, monitoring, and recognising patterns and potential triggers. Specific cognitive rehabilitation and fatigue management strategies were introduced. The ACT-informed component focussed on three core ACT areas of the 'Triflex' of psychological flexibility (Harris, 2019): Being Present, Opening Up, and Doing What Matters. Methods: 118 pwMS attended the NIMIS-MS group intervention which was delivered 14 times in six-week blocks over an 18-month period. To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability, participants completed measures of depression and anxiety (HADS), functional impairment (WSAS), Values- Progress (VQ) and Values- Obstruction (VQ), and Acceptance of MS (MSAS) pre and post NIMIs-MS group intervention. Qualitative feedback was obtained during focus groups after the final session and via online feedback questionnaires Results: Pre-post analysis showed that symptoms of depression and anxiety were significantly lower and acceptance of MS was significantly higher following completion of the NIMIS-MS group. Qualitative feedback showed that participants reported that they felt more equipped to manage the invisible symptoms of MS following completion of the group, and benefited from using ACT-based strategies and techniques. Participants highly valued the peer support that evolved during the NIMIS-MS groups. The online format was considered more accessible than in-person groups, due to less concerns of travel time, cost, fatigue, and comfort and infection. Conclusion: Evaluation suggests that our novel NIMIS-MS groups is an acceptable, beneficial and feasible approach for providing neuropsychological interventions to individuals with MS.",
