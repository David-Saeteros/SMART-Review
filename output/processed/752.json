    "Abstract": "Introduction > Psychosocial determinants can affect the mental health of women who have been diagnosed with gynecological cancer. The aim of this study was to examine how social support and self-esteem are associated with anxiety and depression symptoms in women with gynecological cancer, and who are treated by radical surgery.Methods > A cross-sectional study was performed, within the oncology department of Ibn Rochd University Hospital, Casablanca, on 100 Moroccan women. They all had undergone radical surgery for gynecological cancer, hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy.Results > Our results showed that patients with gynecological cancer treated by radical surgery exhibited high prevalence rates of anxiety (66%) and depression symptoms (59%). Associations showed that age, having children, medical coverage system, area of residence, working status and socioeconomic status were significantly related to the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms (P < 0.05). The general social support, family support and significant other support besides high self-esteem reduce significantly the risk of getting anxiety and depression symptoms (P-values < 0.05).Discussion > Among patients with gynecological cancer treated by radical surgery, high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was found. Social support and high self-esteem could help improve mental health issues related to this type of cancer.",
