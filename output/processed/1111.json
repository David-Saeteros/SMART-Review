    "Article Title": "Implementation and evaluation of recovery-oriented practice interventions for people with mental illness in Asia: An integrative review",
    "Abstract": "Background: Recovery is a process involving empowering individuals to take control of their lives and develop meaningful and purposeful life, regardless of whether their mental health symptoms persist. Recoveryoriented practice has been widely implemented, particularly in Anglophone countries, during the past two decades. Mental health recovery in Asia is also moving towards recovery-oriented practice. Little is known about how recovery-oriented interventions originating in the West have been implemented and evaluated in Asian contexts.Objective: This review aimed to identify 1) types of recovery-oriented practice interventions that have been implemented in Asia, 2) how they have been culturally adapted, 3) barriers and facilitators to implementation, and 4) how the interventions have been evaluated. Design: This is an integrative review.Methods: This integrative review followed Whittemore and Knafl's five-stage framework. Six electronic databases (e.g., PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) were systematically searched from their inception to January 2022 to identify eligible studies published in English language. The key search terms included mental illness, recovery-oriented intervention, and Asia. Studies reporting on implementation and evaluation of recovery-focused interventions in Asian settings were eligible. Quality assessment and narrative synthesis were subsequently undertaken.Results: Thirty-eight studies were included. Seven main types of recovery-oriented intervention were identified: (1) peer programmes; (2) illness management and recovery; (3) individual placement and support; (4) strength model case management; (5) clubhouse model; (6) wellness recovery action plan and (7) psychiatric advance directive, alongside several novel recovery programme. Studies reported cultural adaptations for language, content, cultural norms, religious beliefs, family, and local context. Barriers to implementation included a poor understanding of recovery concepts and inadequate organisational resources. A range of clinical and personal recovery outcome measures were reported.Conclusions: Recovery-oriented interventions are increasing in Asia, with nearly half of reviewed studies featuring cultural adaptations. However, research is geographically skewed, and more rigorously conducted studies are needed across a wider range of Asian countries.Registration: This review was registered with the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42022310049).
