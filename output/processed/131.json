    "Abstract": "Purpose This study sought to better understand the views and practices of disability employment specialists working with clients with mental illness. Specifically, it explored what helps and hinders employment specialists in their work. Materials and methods A constructivist grounded theory methodology was used. Semi-structured interviews with 16 disability employment specialists from four employment service providers in Victoria, Australia, were transcribed and analysed through initial coding, focused coding, and constant comparative methods. Results Analysis led to the substantive grounded theory of moving clients forward. The key themes included taking a firm but fair approach, meeting clients where they are at, getting clients ready for work, managing the interface between clients and employers, and as a consequence, working under pressure. Conclusions These findings contribute the first grounded theory of how Australian disability employment specialists work with clients with mental illness and enhance understanding of employment specialists' notions of job readiness and their use of discretion in implementing seemingly contradictory employment-related policies. Practice tensions for these employment specialists could be reduced by modifying disability employment policies, and through training to deliver evidence-based practices that offer varied vocational services, pathways, and adjunct interventions tailored to clients' interests, needs and readiness for change.",
