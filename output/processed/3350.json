    "Abstract": "Background Workplace violence (WPV) is a growing issue in health care with far-reaching consequences for health workers' physical and psychological well-being. While some medical specialities like emergency medicine have always been considered at higher risk for WPV, several studies have also reported its occurrence in radiology.Aims This systematic review aimed to comprehensively synthesize the types of WPV in radiology, its psychological impact, and the underlying risk and protective factors.Methods We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, PsycINFO and CINAHL) and additional literature, including grey literature, and established weekly search alerts. Two reviewers independently conducted all methodological steps, involving a third reviewer in case of disagreement.Results Of the 12 205 retrieved records, 103 full-text articles were evaluated, and 15 studies were included. Across studies, verbal aggression, sexual harassment (mostly against women) and physical violence were experienced by up to 100%, 85% and 46% of health workers, respectively. Perpetrators were patients and patients' caregivers, followed by co-workers. Victims suffered from various psychological symptoms, such as anxiety (22%-54%), fear (6%-39%), depression (32%) and repeated disturbing memories (21%). Risk factors included female gender, understaffing, worker inexperience, poor communication and lengthy waiting times. Social support and security personnel presence were among the identified protective factors.Conclusions Health workers are at high risk of experiencing WPV in the radiological setting, with a strong psychological impact. Radiological departments should create a safe healthcare environment that actively manages the identified risk factors and offers psychological support to affected workers.Workplace violence is a growing issue in health care, also affecting radiologists. Our systematic review demonstrates that health workers in radiology often experience verbal and physical aggression and sexual harassment and that perpetrators are patients and caregivers, followed by co-workers. Victims suffer from various psychological symptoms like anxiety, fear and depression. Given this evidence, radiological departments should create safe healthcare environments actively managing the identified risk factors and offering psychological support to affected workers.",
