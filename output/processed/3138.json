    "Abstract": "Aims The aim of this study was to identify medical and psychosocial risk factors for impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and poor psychological adjustment (PA) in young adults with congenital heart disease (CHD)Methods and results A group of 188 patients (43% females, ages 18-30 years) with various types of CHD and 139 age-matched healthy controls (57% females) completed questionnaires assessing HRQoL, PA, social support, significant life events in the past year, education level, civil status, and employment status. Medical variables were retrieved from the patients' hospital records. Patients reported worse physical HRQoL than controls but similar mental HRQoL and PA. Female CHD patients showed worse physical and mental HRQoL and poorer PA than males. In CHD patients, a lower educational level and lower physical exercise capacity predicted lower physical HRQoL, but complexity of CHD was not related to HRQoL or PA. Less social support was associated with lower mental HRQoL and poorer PA in CHD patientsConclusion Young adults with CHD have impaired physical HRQoL but normal mental HRQoL and PA. Lower physical exercise capacity, female sex, less social support, and lower educational level predict an unfavourable quality of life and PA. This subgroup of patients should be monitored more closely and provided with special psychosocial care to improve long-term outcome.",
