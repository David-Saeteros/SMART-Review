    "Article Title": "(Un)disclosed. Disease disclosure in people living with rheumatic diseases: An exploratory study",
    "Abstract": "Objective Little is known about disease-related disclosure (DD) in patients with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). We aim to investigate DD behaviors and to explore which socio-demographic, clinical and psychological factors play a role in this self-disclosure process among patients with RMDs. Methods A cross-sectional Italian nationwide study captured DD in RMDs in different contexts (workplace, family, friends, partner, social networks). An ad hoc survey was developed and disseminated by the Patients' Association ALOMAR ODV (Lombard Association for Rheumatic Diseases) between June and July 2020. Patient demographics, clinical data, and questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, anticipated stigma, patient health engagement, perceived social support, and perceived general health status were collected. Results There were 376 rheumatic patients who completed the survey. There were 73.9% of the participants who talk to others about their RMD sometimes; 18.7% disclose their RMD always/very often, while 7.4% never talk about their RMD. A significant association was detected between DD and both perceived visibility (P = .04) and psychological support (P = .01). Moreover, participants who never/sometimes disclose their RMD reported significantly lower scores in the Total Social Support (P < .01) and in the Friends subscale (P < .001) compared to others. Psychological support and the Friends subscale were the only significant predictors of DD (both P = .002). Conclusions The majority of RMD patients disclosed their disease sometimes. The DD behavior is not associated with any specific demographic or clinical variables. Further research on the subject might help to foster better DD decision-making processes for rheumatic patients in different contexts of daily life.",
