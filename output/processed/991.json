    "Abstract": "The challenge of sustainably integrating highly educated individuals with ASD without intellectual disabilities in the first labor market is repeatedly described in literature. In a retrospective study, a group of 197 clinically late-diagnosed adults with ASD without intellectual disabilities was compared to a closely matched group of 501 individuals who did not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of ASD within a utilization population of the Cologne Autism Outpatient Clinic. Results indicated that the pronounced demand for reduction of social and interpersonal requirements at the workplace (including planned or limited contact with colleagues and customers) as well as the experience of difficulties following unexpected changes in the daily routine were specific for ASD. In addition, individuals with ASD reported greater difficulties in finding a suitable job and being able to live on their wages, taking age and educational qualification into account. Supported employment measures were provided significantly more frequently to individuals in the ASD group. In conclusion, impairments in social skills emerged as one of the main obstacles of workplace performance for individuals with ASD emphasizing the necessity to develop and apply ASD-specific support services.",
