    "Abstract": "Purpose. The issue of mental health in France is a growing problem and the prevention of professional exclusion is a priority of the 2015-2019 occupational health plan. The objective of this study is to illustrate the contribution of a cognitive-behavioral approach in consultation suffering and work in an occupational pathology unit.Method. After a description of the cognitive-behavioral therapy's consultation (CBT) to the occupational pathology unit of Garches, on data dating from April 2014 to December 2015, we will discuss the benefits of this approach through examples of two case studies.Results. Twenty-three patients received CBT, with 6 sessions on average focused on issues related to work. After the therapy, thirteen people no more needed monitoring by the consultant doctor working in the occupational pathology unit. First case involves a patient who had a post-traumatic stress disorder typology 1, moderate intensity depression and pessimism disturbing return to work. Second case is a patient who was suffering from an adjustment disorder and affirmation, self-endangering her manager position. CBT sessions allowed for both the resumption of a professional activity.Conclusion. CBT is still little known and practiced in France even if there is clinical evidence of their effectiveness in many mental disorders. Faced with the high number of employees in professional stress disorder, these therapies, short and focused on work, can facilitate access to health care. They thus find their place in consultation suffering and work in occupational pathology unit, with the aim of prevention of professional exclusion, provided to define precise indications.
