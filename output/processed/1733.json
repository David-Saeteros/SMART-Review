    "Article Title": "Return to School Outcomes among Adults with TBI One Year After Rehabilitation Discharge: A TEAMS Study",
    "Abstract": "Objective: To examine return to school outcomes 1 year after traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation discharge.Design: Longitudinal observational study using Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Database (TBIMS-NDB) data at 1-year post-TBI.Setting: Inpatient rehabilitation centers using follow-up telephone calls.Individuals: Individuals (n = 237) enrolled in the TBIMS-NDB since 2001 between the ages of 18 and 59 years who were engaged in postsecondary education (full or part-time) before recorded TBI.Main Measures: Return to school, categorized as in a postsecondary setting at first follow-up (reported hours in school greater than zero at one-year follow-up).Results: Using an alpha level of 0.05 binary logistic regression analysis identified four predictive variables. Significant predictors of return to school include being of lower age, possessing a higher level of functioning at discharge, reporting lower ratings of disability at discharge, and being able to use a vehicle independently for transportation.Conclusion: Pursuit of higher education is a viable means of community reintegration after TBI. Some individuals with TBI face a myriad of barriers and challenges when returning to school. Study findings may facilitate understanding of how TBI affects return to school and community reintegration outcomes.",
