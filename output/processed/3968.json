    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Healthcare professionals are often subjected to demanding working conditions, and both burnout and work engagement are psychological reactions that develop when personality traits interact with the characteristics of the work. The objective of this study was to analyse the factors that influence burnout and work engagement levels among healthcare professionals. Methods: A systematic review of articles published between January 2015 and October 2020 was conducted in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect electronic databases, following the PRISMA format. Methodological quality was assessed through the critical evaluation tools for non-randomised studies by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Results: A total of 27 studies were included in this review. Moderate levels of work engagement and low levels of burnout were observed among healthcare professionals. Job demands (work overload, shift type, negative events, type of service, etc.) and personal, situational, and organisational resources (psychological capital, social support, ability to express emotions, personal values, feeling self-fulfilled, among others) may be factors that influence work engagement and burnout levels. Conclusions: The results provide implications for the design, assessment and effectiveness of workplace interventions towards reducing the risk of burnout and improving work engagement levels among healthcare professionals.",
