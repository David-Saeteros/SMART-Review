    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had an exceptional impact on the healthcare profession, and in particular, on the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare workers. The Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists (CAMRT) has been working on ways to prioritize the mental health of their members while increasing advocacy efforts. Conducting a national survey on mental health and interviewing medical radiation technologists (MRTs) highlighted the challenges that exist while also informing which support system components are most needed to improve wellbeing. The purpose of the research is to share the lived experience of Canadian MRTs in relation to their mental health during the pandemic. It adds to the knowledge gained from the survey by exploring in depth accounts of what MRTs felt and experienced during COVID-19. Understanding this challenging time period may aid in developing additional resources and support for MRTs in the workplace. The overall message in healthcare should be, optimize your wellbeing and your patients will be taken care of too. Recommendations to foster this message includes empowering MRTs to advocate for their mental health and wellbeing, promoting timely and adequate supports, monitoring the mental health of our professional landscape and welcoming others to join the conversation. This paper examines what mental health supports are recommended by the MRTs who were interviewed, and the information gathered from the CAMRT Mental Health of Medical Radiation Technologists in Canada 2021 Survey.",
