    "Abstract": "This manuscript aims to synthesize what is known, and what is unknown, about immigrants' experiences of work-family interaction, specifically the work-family conflict, in the U.S. A systematic review method was conducted using multiple electronic databases. After applying inclusion criteria, six studies were included. Immigrant workers across studies in this systematic review reported experiencing work-family conflict. Four categories of factors associated with immigrants' work-family conflict were identified: (1) work-domain factors, (2) family-domain factors, (3) health outcomes, and (4) immigration, acculturation, and gender roles. In the work domain, job demands are positively associated with work-family conflict, while having job control and job support are negatively associated with work-family conflict. More domestic work demands and economic responsibilities in the family domain have contributed to work-family conflict, whereas having domestic support for childcare and housework helped mitigate work-family conflict. This review shows that work-family conflict has contributed to deteriorating physical and mental health outcomes among immigrants. Most importantly, this study reveals that immigration per se has uniquely shaped immigrants' work-family interactions through the separation from family and community, the salience of employment, losing networks of social support, transitioning from collectivist cultures to an individualistic culture, and modified gender roles.",
