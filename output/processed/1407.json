    "Article Title": "Risk of depression following traumatic limb amputation-a general population-based cohort study",
    "Abstract": "Background: Individuals with traumatic limb amputation (TLA) may be at risk of depression, but evidence of increased depression after TLA from longitudinal studies has been limited. It is also unknown whether physical function, cognitive function, and employment prior to amputation affects depression risk. We aimed to examine longitudinal associations between TLA and depression in working age men, and to explore the role of pre-amputation occupational and individual characteristics. Methods: A Swedish national register-based cohort of 189,220 men born between 1952 and 1956, and who attended conscription assessments in adolescence, was followed from 1985 to 2009. Physical, cognitive, and psychological characteristics were measured at the conscription examination, and occupational information was obtained from the 1985 census. Main outcome measures were hospital inpatient and outpatient admissions for depression. Results: In total, 401 men underwent TLA; mean age at amputation was 42.5 years (SD 7.4). Cox regression produced an unadjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.61 (1.62-4.21) for risk of subsequent depression associated with TLA compared with the general population. Adjustment for occupational, physical, cognitive, and psychological characteristics did not change the association much, producing a hazard ratio of 2.53 (1.57-4.08). Conclusions: TLA is associated with an increased risk of depression in men over more than two decades of follow up. Occupational and individual characteristics prior to amputation did not greatly change depression risk following amputation. We speculate that a coordinated combination of social support and medical management may help reduce persistent depression risk in men who experience amputation.",
