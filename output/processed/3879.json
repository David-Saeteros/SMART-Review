    "Abstract": "Objective: Peer support practice has seen exponential growth during the past several decades. While there exists a body of research on job satisfaction among this emerging workforce, many studies had limited sample sizes and demographic diversity and focused on few facets of job satisfaction. The present study examines multiple factors associated with job satisfaction and compensates for limitations of previous smaller studies. Methods: A convenience/snowball sample of 645 peer support staff was recruited via National Association of Peer Supporters and Academy of Peer Services listservs. Eligible participants were at least 18 years of age, currently employed for a minimum of 6 months, and residing in one of the 50 states or one of U.S. territories. Global and multidimensional facets of job satisfaction were measured using the Indiana Job Satisfaction Survey. Results: Data from an anonymous online survey were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression. The main hypothesis was supported; coworker support, perceived organizational support, supervisor support, and job empowerment explained 71% of the variance in overall job satisfaction, Adj R-2 = 0.71, F(9, 271) = 77.77, p < .01, with age and status as a certified peer specialist significant contributors. Perceived organizational support and job empowerment explained most variance in overall job satisfaction. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: As this workforce continues to burgeon, it is crucial to promote peer support values, role clarity, certification, diversity, and optimal organizational and empowerment resources to sustain a satisfied and effective peer support workforce.",
