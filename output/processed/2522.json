    "Article Title": "Emerging Adults' Perspectives of Received Youth Worker Support and Their Personal and Structural Barriers to Find Employment or Further Education: A Qualitative Study From Sweden",
    "Abstract": "Transitioning successfully into the workforce is an essential step toward adulthood; yet there are significant challenges many emerging adults face. In Sweden, there is a noticeable gap in research concerning the perspectives of these individuals, particularly regarding their barriers and support needs. To bridge this knowledge gap, a qualitative study was conducted, involving semi-structured interviews with 22 Swedish emerging adults who were neither employed nor engaged in education or training (NEET). The aim was to delve deeper into their views on the necessary personal and systemic support to secure employment or pursue further education. The analysis revealed three main themes: Flawed capabilities, Support systems, and Emerging adults' determination. While the participants acknowledged the benefits of personal and systemic support, they also expressed that obstacles within these support structures hindered their progress towards employment or education. Reducing these barriers could significantly enhance the prospects for NEET young adults to obtain work or continue their education.",
