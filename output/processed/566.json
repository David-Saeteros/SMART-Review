    "Article Title": "Client, Contextual and Program Elements Influencing Supported Employment: A Literature Review",
    "Abstract": "Supported employment is an evidence-based practice with a well-established research base. Most studies track such outcomes as employment rates, time to employment and wages earned. Few studies address client and contextual factors that impact outcomes or consider program elements beyond those that comprise the individual placement and support model. This paper reviews existing literature to shed light on the following questions: (1) What impact do labour market trends have on the effectiveness of SE? (2) How lasting are the effects of SE and what factors influence longevity of SE effects? (3) What levels and types of employment are targeted by SE? (4) What are the characteristics of people who benefit from SE? (5) What is the role of peer support in SE? and (6) What are the barriers to effective SE implementation? Research findings are synthesized and suggestions for service enhancements are offered so that the model can continue to evolve.",
