    "Abstract": "Mental health has been a focus of over 200 journal articles using the HILDA Survey data. This brief review provides an overview of the mental health data collected through the HILDA Survey, and discusses the potential reasons why HILDA Survey data have been used so frequently in mental health research. We reflect on how the HILDA Survey data have: provided insights into the profile of mental health in the Australian community, illustrated the importance of social ties for mental health and enabled investigation of social inequalities in mental health.",
