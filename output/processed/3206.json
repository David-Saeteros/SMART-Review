    "Abstract": "Impact and Implications This study illustrates how young adults experienced self-stigma in response to a psychosis diagnosis in young adulthood and how this delayed their career pathways. Natural peer support was critical in restoring self-identity and career pathways among young people with first-episode psychosis. Study findings have implications for improving Coordinated Specialty Care practice to include peer-based and other anti-stigma interventions for young adults with first-episode psychosis.Objective: This study explored the pathways to employment, education, and/or disability among young adults with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP) with the intent to reduce poverty and disability among this population. Method: Using a critical case design, 10 young adults (ages 21-28) completed two qualitative interviews exploring the key moments that influenced their pathway toward employment and education or disability after experiencing a first-episode of psychosis. Participants had lived experience of an FEP, had completed a Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) program, and were members of the Early Assessment and Support Alliance's Young Adult Leadership Council (YALC). Qualitative analysis was completed using a four-step template approach and focus group. Results: Early stigmatizing behavior by hospital staff and the diagnostic label of psychosis challenged participants' self-identity and self-confidence which led to a pause in vocational activities. Meeting peers (i.e., other individuals who had experienced a first-episode of psychosis) through their CSC program normalized their psychosis diagnosis and alleviated feelings of self-stigma; this was integral in returning to and initiating new employment and education goals. YALC involvement provided opportunities for practicing work skills, such as public speaking, and additional peer support that further eradicated self-stigma and improved connection to employment. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Implications for CSC models include broad consideration of the ways that early psychiatric labeling can construct self-stigma, and how this phenomenon stunts the self-confidence needed to pursue employment and education goals. Specific recommendations include utilizing peer connections, peer spaces, and peer-delivered anti-stigma interventions to enhance employment and education pathways.",
