    "Article Title": "Midlife Transition Experiences of South Asian Immigrant Women in Canada: A Qualitative Exploration",
    "Abstract": "Background South Asians make up a significant portion of the immigrant population in Canada, and a large portion of them are in their midlife. To improve the midlife transition of South Asian immigrant women, it is necessary to understand their lived experiences. Purpose Guided by the transition theory, this study investigates the midlife experiences of South Asian immigrant women in Canada. Methods Twenty-two South Asian midlife, immigrant women were recruited to participate in this study from the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. This study consisted of one asynchronous online focus group with 12 participants and ten one-on-one telephone interviews. Qualitative content analysis was guided by transition theory. Results South Asian immigrant women experienced many different transitions in their midlife in Canada. These transitions included changes in their (a) lifestyle, (b) career, (c) family, (d) physical health, (e) mental health, (f) social, (g) environment, and (h) personal development. Women actively managed their transitions using strategies such as exercise, socialization, counseling, and religion. Women expressed the need for social, community, and governmental support to facilitate their midlife transitions. Conclusion To promote healthy midlife transition, governments need to create better employment policies to facilitate immigrant women settlement, transferring skills, and re-employment in Canada. In addition, health care and community services to promote physical and mental health should be emphasized.",
