    "Abstract": "Activities of daily living (ADLs) are activities that people engage in on a routine basis, such as brushing their teeth, preparing a meal, and caring for their child. Independence with ADLs is associated with better outcomes in independent living, education, employment, relationships, and mental health. Therefore, this perspective piece includes a review of the literature and assessment databases to identify and summarize ADL assessments for Autistic adults. These assessments were compared and analyzed using the neurodiversity paradigm. Specifically, we compared assessments using predetermined priorities the authors identified: (1) assessment type, (2) inclusivity, and (3) performance factors. We identified five unique norm-referenced measures, four performancebased measures, and a variety of checklists, surveys, questionnaires, and/or interviews used to assess ADL performance among Autistic adults. The authors present their perspectives regarding the challenges with the current assessments, including the high-frequency use of norm-referenced assessments, lack of inclusivity, and failure to consider performance factors (e.g., sensory, motor, and emotional), and the paucity of assessments designed specifically for Autistic adults older than 30 years. In response to these challenges, we recommend researchers partner with Autistic adults to develop a new assessment tool. If researchers or clinicians are using existing measures, we recommend that they utilize self-report over proxy-report and include methods to improve the accessibility of the assessment. We also recommend that clinicians and researchers offer breaks, comfort objects, or sensory modifications during the assessment to decrease anxiety; and ask follow-up questions to understand whether environment or emotional health are impacting one's ADL performance.",
