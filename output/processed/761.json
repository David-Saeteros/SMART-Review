    "Article Title": "Psychiatric Rehabilitation - From the Linear Continuum Approach Towards Supported Inclusion",
    "Abstract": "Background: For many decades, psychiatric rehabilitation in the German-speaking countries is following a conventional linear continuum approach.Methods: Recent developments in important fields related to psychiatric rehabilitation (UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, theory of rehabilitation, empirical research) are reviewed.Results: Common to all developments in the reviewed fields are the principles of choice, autonomy and social inclusion. These principles contradict the conventional linear continuum approach.Conclusions: The linear continuum approach of psychiatric rehabilitation should be replaced by the supported inclusion-approach.",
