    "Article Title": "Psychosocial Support in Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer",
    "Abstract": "Various forms of psychosocial support have been suggested in working with adolescents and young adults (AYAs) as they attempt to cope with cancer, including peer-based interventions, individual psychoeducational counseling, and skill-based interventions. More recently, modern electronic applications created technology-based ways to deliver information and support and have grown in popularity to satisfy AYA needs for information and support. Such support should be offered routinely rather than in a response to a crisis. This article focuses on psychosocial interventions for AYAs aged 15 to 39 years with cancer at diagnosis, during treatment, and shortly after.",
