    "Abstract": "Objectives: Despite promising research showing that physical activity (PA) might improve cognitive functioning in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), people with MCI are less physically active compared with the general population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess PA correlates among community-dwelling older people with MCI in six low-and middle-income countries.Design: Cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analysed.Methods: PA level was assessed by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. 4854 participants with MCI (mean age 64.4 years; 55.1% females) were grouped into those who do and do not (low PA) meet the 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week recommendation. Associations between PA and the correlates were examined using multivariable logistic regressions.Results: The prevalence of low PA was 27.4% (95% confidence interval = 25.0-30.0). In the multivariable analysis, older age and unemployment were the only sociodemographic correlates of low PA. The significant positive correlates of low PA in other domains included depression, being underweight, obesity, asthma, chronic lung disease, hearing problems, visual impairment, slow gait, weak grip strength, poor self-rated health, and lower levels of social cohesion.Conclusions: The current data illustrate that a number of sociodemographic and health factors are associated with PA levels among older people with MCI. The promotion of social cohesion may increase the efficacy of public health initiatives while from a health care perspective, somatic co-morbidities, muscle strength and slow gait need to be considered when activating those at risk for dementia.
