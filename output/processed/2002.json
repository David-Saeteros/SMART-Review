    "Abstract": "Background and ObjectivesTraumatic brain injury (TBI) may be a chronic condition carrying risk of future sequelae; few prospective studies examine long-term postinjury outcomes. We examined the prevalence of functional, cognitive, and psychiatric change outcomes from 1 to 7 years postinjury.MethodsTransforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI LONG (TRACK-TBI LONG) participants were prospectively enrolled within 24 hours of injury and followed up to 1 year postinjury; a subset participated in long-term follow-up from 2 to 7 years postinjury. Reliable change thresholds for the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone General Composite (cognition) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)-18 (psychiatric) were derived from orthopedic trauma controls (OTCs). Multiple assessments were completed (postinjury baseline assessment and 2 or 3 visits 2-7 years postinjury) within a sample subset. Change was assessed for functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOSE]) and self-report/informant report of decline. Prevalence ratios for outcomes classified as stable, improved, and declined were reported individually and collectively. The Fisher exact test and log-binomial regression models examined factors associated with decline and improvement.ResultsOf the sample (N = 1,264; mild TBI [mTBI], Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 13-15, n = 917; moderate-to-severe TBI [msTBI], GCS 3-12, n = 193; or OTC n = 154), stable was the most prevalent outcome. Functional outcome showed the highest rates of decline, regardless of TBI severity (mild = 29%; moderate/severe = 23%). When measures were collectively considered, rates of decline included mTBI (21%), msTBI (26%), and OTC (15%). Age and preinjury employment status were associated with functional decline (per 10 years; relative risk [RR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.25, p < 0.001; higher in retired/disabled/not working vs full-time/part-time; RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.33-2.45, respectively) in the mTBI group. Improvement in functional recovery 2-7 years postinjury was associated with higher BSI scores (per 5 points; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.18, p = 0.002) and GOSE score of 5-7 (GOSE = 8 as reference; RR 2.64, 95% CI 1.75-3.97, p < 0.001). Higher BSI scores and identifying as Black (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.59-3.25, p < 0.001) were associated with a greater likelihood of improved psychiatric symptoms in mTBI (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.14-1.29, p < 0.001). A greater likelihood of cognitive improvement was observed among those with higher educational attainment in msTBI (per 4 years; RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.43-4.79, p = 0.002).DiscussionFunction across domains at 1-year postinjury, a common recovery benchmark, undergoes change across the subsequent 6 years. Results support consideration of TBI as a chronic evolving condition and suggest continued monitoring, rehabilitation, and support is required to optimize long-term independence and quality of life.",
