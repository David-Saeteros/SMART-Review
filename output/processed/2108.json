    "Abstract": "Introduction: Associated with the illiteracy of what to do to prevent, delay, and when to seek help, in the face of schizophrenia, the nurse specialist in mental health is required to act ethically, based on empirical, technical-scientific knowledge, involving professional duties: dignity, individuality and autonomy. Objective: To promote mental health literacy by analysing the illness of a person with schizophrenia and the ethical issues associated with mental health nursing care. Methodology: Case study - film A Brilliant Mind, of a qualitative, exploratory- descriptive nature. Results and Discussion: Schizophrenia transforms the way of thinking, feeling, and relating to people, leading to stigmatisation associated with connecting myths between mental illness and violence, contributing to difficulty/exclusion in employment, social support and seeking help. Conclusion: The promotion of literacy on how to act towards a person with schizophrenia, and the inherent ethical care in nursing, are highlighted.",
