    "Article Title": "Characteristics and prevention of burnout syndrome among nurses",
    "Abstract": "Within the health care system, nurses face multiple hazards from the aspect of burnout syndrome (emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and reduced personal accomplishment) development. Burnout has a negative impact on the health and economic status of individuals. Moreover, burnout diminishes compliance, reduces the quality of care, and it influences the prevalence of medical malpractice and complications. Therefore the identification, prevention and treatment of burnout are of public interest. In this study, we present the occurrence of burnout among Hungarian nurses, and we recommend options to prevent the burnout of nurses, focusing especially on the role and possibilities of psychological counselling. All these provide practical aspects and feasibility in preventing and overcoming burnout.",
