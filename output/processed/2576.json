    "Article Title": "Changes in Parental Emotional Support and Psychological Control in Early Adulthood: Direct and Indirect Associations With Educational and Occupational Adjustment",
    "Abstract": "Early adulthood is a critical period during which real-world adjustment sets the stage for lifelong well-being. However, little is known about how the emotional quality of parental relationships may help or hinder adjustment. This longitudinal study investigated (a) changes in mother and father emotional support and psychological control during early adulthood, (b) whether such changes predicted young adults' educational and occupational adjustment, and (c) whether these associations occurred indirectly through young adults' depressive and anxiety symptoms. Participants were 240 youth assessed at four time points over a 6-year period. Multilevel modeling showed that on average, parental emotional support increased and psychological control decreased over time. Latent growth curve mediation analyses revealed significant direct associations between parental emotional support and psychological control and adjustment outcomes as well as indirect effects through mental health symptoms. Findings particularly highlight the negative effects of parental psychological control on young adults' academic and occupational adjustment.",
