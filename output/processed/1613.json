    "Abstract": "Background: School-to-work transition programmes play a crucial role in the achievement of post-secondary outcomes for young adults with intellectual disability (ID). Although special education in China has progressed in the last two decades, systematically planned transition education and services are not usually available for Chinese school leavers.Aims: The present study aimed to validate Kohler's Taxonomy of Transition Programming (KTTP) in the Chinese context for adolescents with ID.Methods and procedures: Five Chinese transition experts reviewed KTTP items, 14 Chinese transition teachers and 14 parents of adolescents with ID who would transition from school in the next 12 months were interviewed, and 329 transition teachers were surveyed.Outcome and results: Most items in KTTP were found to be important and relevant to the Chinese context. Based on KTTP, a modified transition framework appropriate to the Chinese context was generated.Conclusions and implications: The Chinese transition framework may assist parents and professionals to better support adolescents with ID in China. Future validation checks of the framework will add confidence that the framework captures the essential components of effective transition practices appropriate in the Chinese context.
