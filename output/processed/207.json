    "Abstract": "Identifying as LGBTQIA+ is associated with greater risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI); understanding why may aid in decreasing NSSI and associated risks in this vulnerable population. We examined discrimination, psychological distress, 'outness', resilience, and NSSI in 330 young adults (18-30) from the Australian LGBTQIA+ community. Individuals reporting NSSI reported more depression, anxiety and stress, and less resilience than those who had not engaged in NSSI. Perceived discrimination was not associated with NSSI engagement, however people identifying as queer reported more discrimination than other LGBTQIA+ participants. Additionally, not being 'out' in the workplace was associated with NSSI. Building resilience and social support within and for the LGBTQIA+ community may be beneficial in addressing LGBTQIA+ mental health and NSSI.",
