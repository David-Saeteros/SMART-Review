    "Abstract": "Background Few studies have been conducted to explore medication non-adherence in persons with schizophrenia (PWS) and its influencing factors in rural China. This study aimed to investigate the medication non-adherence and its influencing factors among PWS in rural China. Methods A total of 269 PWS and their family caregivers in Xinjin district, Chengdu, China were investigated on medication adherence and related factors. Logistic regression was employed to identify the influencing factors. Results The results showed that 37.6% of PWS had medication non-adherence. PWS living with family caregivers had significantly lower rate of medication non-adherence (34.7%) than those not living with family caregivers (60.0%) (p < 0.01). Family caregivers' affiliate stigma of mental illness, knowledge of mental illness and self-esteem were significantly related to patients' medication non-adherence (p < 0.05). PWS' employment status, living with family caregiver, present mental status and social support were significantly related to medication adherence. Conclusion This study shows medication non-adherence is severe among PWS in rural China. Both patient- and family-related factors affect patients' medication adherence seriously. Except improving patients' treatment and mental status, development of family caregiving, social support network and intervention on reducing stigma of mental illness should be crucial for enhancing PWS' medication adherence.",
