    "Abstract": "Actigraphy is a versatile tool for evaluating sleep-wake cycles over time in the home-environment. Patients using the Phillips Actiwatch place an event marker when going to sleep and upon awakening. We investigate compliance in pressing the Actiwatch event marker button for patients referred for insomnia, hypersomnia and disorders of circadian rhythm. We retrospectively analysed event markers from 150 patients undergoing actigraphy for 2,117 nights combined. Compliance was evaluated from inspection of actigraphy records, and coded as full or partial. From patient records, a construct called the C-factor, designed to describe poor social resources and chronic unemployment, was used together with age and sex to predict compliance. We found a mean compliance between 54.0% and 76.3% for a median monitoring duration of 14 days. There was an overall insignificant effect of age (p = .081), but when analysed only for females there was a significant effect of 0.56% pr. year (p = .0038). Compliance was higher for women, Cohen's d = 0.65 (p = .01). The C-factor predicts 18.3% (confidence interval 9%-27.5%) lower compliance. Morning and evening compliance are correlated at r = .65. In conclusion, actigraphy event marker compliance is generally moderate or high, with older women exhibiting the highest compliance. C-factor predicts lower compliance, and this pattern may further translate to other circumstances. If compliance is important, clinicians may want to consider the effects of age, sex and C-factor.",
