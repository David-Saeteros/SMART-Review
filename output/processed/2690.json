    "Article Title": "The Effects of Dysfunctional Workplace Behavior on Teacher Emotional Exhaustion: A Moderated Mediation Model of Perceived Social Support and Anxiety",
    "Abstract": "Dysfunctional workplace behavior (DWB) is a prevalent phenomenon in schools, which has adverse consequences for teachers and students. In addition to the known negative implications, little is known about the mechanism through which DWB functions. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of DWB on teacher emotional exhaustion (EE) and understand whether perceived social support (PSS) moderates the mediating effect that anxiety has on the relationship between DWB and EE. A battery of measurement tools was administered to 249 English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in Iran. Moderated mediation regressions were used to analyze survey data. Results indicated that anxiety mediated the relationship between DWB and EE. Additionally, it was found that PSS moderated the direct relationship between DWB and anxiety; and the indirect relationship between DWB and EE. DWB was more strongly associated with an increased incidence of anxiety and EE in teachers with low levels of PSS. Results highlight the need to understand the intervening factors and sources of EE to actively identify, assess, and control teachers' behavioral and mental health risk factors. Given the significant role of emotions in teacher well-being, it is imperative to develop effective interventions (e.g., promoting PSS and positive workplace behaviors) in order to optimize teachers' emotional and behavioral health.",
