    "Abstract": "Purpose of review Since the turn of the new millennium, care for people with intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorders (IDD) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has drawn increasing attention because of the continuous prevalence increase of these two conditions, the high health vulnerability, especially mental vulnerability, and the crucial role of care provision in the setting of continued deinstitutionalization and the shift to community care. The present review addresses the main issues related to mental healthcare in youth with IDD and/or ASD with a specific focus on adolescence and transition to adulthood.Recent findings Despite the existence of specific recommendations, persons with IDD/ASD lack access to quality mental healthcare within communities, receive inadequate diagnosis and intervention, including medication overuse as well as ineffective residential, educational, employment, financial, and social support services. The lack of a unified care system that provides services across all domains and life ages may be the cause of users' perceptions and experiences of inefficiencies.Summary The scientific community seems to converge on that care should be provided in accordance with principles of interdisciplinarity, life-span view, precision, personalization, and participation. Quality of life appears to be an ideal conceptual reference for care planning and outcome evaluation.",
