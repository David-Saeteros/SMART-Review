    "Article Title": "Does Social Capital in the Workplace Predict Job Performance, Work Engagement, and Psychological Well-Being? A Prospective Analysis",
    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the prospective association between social capital in the workplace and self-reported job performance, work engagement, and psychological well-being. Methods: Survey data on 538 employees in the dairy industry were analyzed using linear multilevel regression analysis. Social capital was analyzed as individual-level and aggregated team-level variables. Follow-up time was approximately 2 years. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, outcome measured at T1, and random effects at team level. Results: Individual-level social capital at T1 predicted self-reported job performance, and psychological well-being at T2. Changes in individual-level and team-level social capital from T1 to T2 were significantly associated with self-reported job performance, work engagement, and psychological well-being at T2. Conclusions: Social capital in the workplace is associated with relevant outcomes for work organizations. Workplace interventions to enhance social capital are recommended.",
