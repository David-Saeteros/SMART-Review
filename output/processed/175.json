    "Abstract": "Healthcare workers are people who work in health activities, whether or not they have direct contact with citizens. Currently, around 1.3 million people (70% women) work in healthcare activities in Spain. This represents around 10% of the active population, having increased by 33% since 2008, especially the number of women, which has doubled. Healthcare organizations, especially hospitals, are extremely complex workplaces, with precarious working and employment conditions, especially in more hierarchical occupations, exposing healthcare workers to numerous occupational hazards, mainly from ergonomic and psychosocial conditions. These causes frequent musculoskeletal and mental disorders, highlighting burnout, which is estimated at 40% in some services such as intensive care units. This high morbidity is reflected in a high frequency of absences due to illness, around 9% after the pandemic. The pandemic, and its consequences in the last three years, has put extreme pressure on the health system and has clearly shown its deficiencies in relation to working and employment conditions. The hundreds of occupational health professionals, technicians and healthcare workers, who are part of the structures of health organizations, constitute very valuable resources to increase the resilience of the NHS. We recommend the strengthening in resources and institutionally of the occupational health services of health centers and the creation of an Observatory of working, employment and health conditions in the National Health Service, as an instrument for monitoring changes and proposing solutions.
