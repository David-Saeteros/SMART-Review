    "Abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine associations between: family support during the school-age period, and school-age bullying (short-term associations); and family support during the school-age period and workplace bullying (long-term associations) for lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adults in Britain.Design/methodology/approachThe authors employ retrospective questions regarding family support for LGB children and school-age bullying and questions regarding workplace bullying in the respondents' present jobs. A 2016 data set was utilized which was created by attending events during the UK LGBT History Month.FindingsThe empirical investigation demonstrates that supportive family environments toward LGB children reduce both school-age and workplace bullying.Practical implicationsGiven the increasing number of people self-identifying as LGB, the significant percentages of school and workplace bullying incidents and the corresponding negative effects on people's lives, it is important to examine the benefits of family support with regards to reducing school and workplace victimization. This study also reports that family support could have an enduring influence on the experiences of LGB children and adults.Originality/valueNo known research has considered the possible developmental benefits of family support on reducing future workplace bullying for LGB children. In addition, this might be the first study which simultaneously examines family support toward LGB children, school-age and workplace bullying.",
