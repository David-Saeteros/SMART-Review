    "Abstract": "Introduction: Young people aging out of the child welfare system face significant barriers to their transition into adulthood including issues related to housing, employment, education, and involvement in the criminal justice system. To be able to develop effective, evidence-based interventions that can help support them, we need to understand which aspects of current interventions work, under what conditions and for whom they work. The present systematic review synthesizes available scientific evidence on interventions for youth transitioning out of the child welfare system in high-income countries. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2009 checklist. We used a comprehensive search strategy across six electronic databases to identify relevant scientific publications: Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, Social Sciences Citation Index and Social Work Abstracts. Following duplicate removal, abstract and full-text screening, we ultimately included 30 studies in the final review. Following risk of bias assessment and data extraction, we chose narrative synthesis to summarize findings from quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies by intervention themes. Results: We identified eight intervention themes across evaluated interventions: independent living readiness; policy changes allowing youth to remain in care beyond the age of majority; mentorship; art/mindfulness; education support; employment support; self-empowerment; and informal learning opportunities. Independent living readiness programs are the most commonly studied programs. Results on their effectiveness are mixed, showing positive results for employment outcomes, improved housing stability, lower legal system involvement and decreased levels of mental health problems, but not for educational attainment or social support. Results from studies on the effectiveness of policy changes that allow youth to remain in care beyond the age of majority and on employment support programs were mixed. Studies on mentorship programs, educational programs, art/ mindfulness programs provide no evidence of effectiveness. Conclusion: The scarcity of rigorous evaluation studies renders the identification of components for effective interventions to support youth transitioning out of care difficult. While results found in the current systematic review offer an evidence-base for the development of effective interventions for youth transitioning out of care, more rigorous evaluation studies are needed to help understand what works, in what context and for what populations of transitioning youth.",
