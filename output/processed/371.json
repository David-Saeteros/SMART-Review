    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most prevalent mental health diagnosis is anxiety disorder, which remains largely undertreated.OBJECTIVE: This investigation considered differences in workplace discrimination against adults with anxiety disorders during two eras of legal history: the original Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA, 1990-2008) and the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA, 2009-present). METHOD: Research questions addressed differential (a) numbers and types of allegations, (b) case resolutions, and (c) demographic characteristics of the charging parties.RESULTS: Results indicated substantially more allegations and merit-based resolutions filed by charging parties with anxiety disorders post-ADAAA. Furthermore, the post-ADAAA era revealed increases in allegations from women and people from non-white racial groups.CONCLUSION: These findings can inform advocacy and counseling and rehabilitation services for clients who experience anxiety.",
