    "Article Title": "The Impact of Vitiligo on Quality of Life and Psychosocial Well-Being in a Nepalese Population",
    "Abstract": "The authors' cohort of vitiligo patients predominantly were young adult men with some education who experienced psychosocial distress and faced many day-to-day problems as a consequence of their visible skin disease. The most important contributors to psychosocial distress were social discrimination and stigmatization, misinformation on vitiligo, and untreated mental health concerns, summarized in Fig. 6. The importance of recognizing this psychosocial distress through open dialogues with patients is highlighted, because it may not be fully detected with quantitative survey instruments, such as the VIS and VitiQoL Psychosocial distress often can go undiagnosed in developing countries like Nepal, which have limited health care resources to allocate to dermatology and mental health. To best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study of its kind in Nepal to combine a vitiligo awareness campaign and educational event with meaningful data collection to further knowledge about this prevalent disease in the population. The authors present the design of an awareness campaign as an example that could be a model for others looking to increase education and awareness for visible skin diseases like vitiligo in their patient populations.",
