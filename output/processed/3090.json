    "Abstract": "The notion of coexisting disadvantages has been recognised in social welfare policy and welfare research, not least in the Nordic countries. The prevalence and patterning of coexisting disadvantages in society have far reaching implications for well-being, social policy, and social inequality. Using longitudinal register-based data for the years 19982008 for all Swedish individuals born 19461965 (n>2.4 million), this exploratory study maps out the occurrence of coexisting disadvantages in the Swedish working-age population, and examines to what extent observed prevalence rates are associated with sex, age, immigrant status, and marital status. Coexisting disadvantages are analysed in terms of four broad register-based indicators intended to capture individuals' resources in key areas of the society: education, income, labour market, and mental health. The results show that while most individuals are not disadvantaged in these areas, coexisting disadvantages do occur and its prevalence varies according to sex, age, immigrant status, and marital status. This study shows that combinations of person-centred and variable-centred analyses of register-based indicators can play a part when developing effective systems for policy surveillance.",
