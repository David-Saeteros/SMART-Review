    "Article Title": "Investigating Barriers to Family Visitation of Nursing Home Residents: A Systematic Review",
    "Abstract": "Families are integral in helping nursing home residents maintain feelings of social inclusion and an overall sense of belonging, thus reducing consequences of social exclusion. Preliminary research, particularly of the culture change movement in long-term care, shows there are barriers to family engagement and visitation of residents. The objective of this study is to: (1) identify and summarize the barriers most reported to family visitation and (2) synthesize the findings to determine which barriers are most often reported in literature, and which may pose the greatest challenges to family involvement. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a final sample of 15 articles across 11 databases report seven barriers to visitation: psychological, health, staff to family member relationship, employment/finances, travel time, access to transportation, and other. Findings suggest barriers to family visitation and point toward a need for further research as relationships between resident and family member is complex and warrants attention across professions. Interprofessional efforts between social work, allied professionals, and transportation planners are necessary to address this pressing concern experienced by residents in nursing homes, with the ultimate goal of lessening such barriers.",
