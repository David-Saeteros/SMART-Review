    "Abstract": "Abstract The literature shows the existence of a relationship between mental health, the perception of quality of life, health status, academic and professional results and social support. The present study aims to analyze the relationship between Quality of Life and Perception of Social Support and consists of two sub-studies, the first targeting children and adolescents and the second that focuses on adults and the elderly. There are differences related to gender, age, health status and socioeconomic status (SES). Regardless of age, was found a positive relationship is identified between the perceived quality of life and the positive perception of social support, throughout life, as well as specifics related to gender, SES, health status and employment status. The situation of groups at higher risk also penalizes female participants, older participants in each of the studies (adolescents and the elderly), participants with chronic illness, participants with medium/low SES and retirees, among adult and elderly participants. These results have important implications in terms of public policies for the family, school and work, which must be taken in consideration in the organization of citizen-friendly services in order to allow the creation and consolidation of social support and a higher quality of life. Special focus on socioeconomic, health and gender inequities.",
