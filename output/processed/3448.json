    "Abstract": "Purpose Research on factors affecting parenting for Latino families with young children is predominately reported using the aggregate category, Hispanic which obfuscates the unique contexts and challenges of specific ethnic/racial groups. Aggregate reporting of results obscures the unique social, cultural and historical experiences that inform parenting behaviors of historically marginalized families. This paper explores within group differences for Mexican and Puerto Rican mothers vulnerable to child welfare involvement. Methods Data were drawn from the National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-being II-Restricted Release (NSCAW-II), a nationally representative sample of child welfare involved families. Results Puerto Rican mothers were found to have significantly higher rates of risk factors (e.g., unemployment, depression, and IPV) compared to Mexican mothers. Implications/Discussion:Results from this study illuminate within-group heterogeneity among Latina mothers related to their vulnerabilities to child welfare involvement. Attention to heterogeneity of Hispanic mothers allow for more refined assessments and interventions.",
