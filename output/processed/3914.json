    "Abstract": "A lack of recovery like psychologically detaching from work can be detrimental to health. High cognitive demands may jeopardise detachment from work. Longitudinal studies concerning the long-term effects of cognitive demands on health and work ability via psychological detachment are understudied. Research has shown that social support may buffer the relationship between job demands and psychological detachment. However, the role of supervisor support was not examined specifically. We hypothesise psychological detachment to mediate the relationship between cognitive demands, general health, and work ability. Supportive or inconsiderate behaviours of a supervisor can further moderate the relationship between cognitive demands and psychological detachment. Statistical analyses were carried out with three-wave panel data from the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health with lags of two years (2015-2019) from 3,867 employees who took part in the survey. The results conveyed that mediation by psychological detachment was significant, while supervisor (non)support moderated the relationship between cognitive demands and psychological detachment only cross-sectionally. This study emphasises the role of supervisor in the stressor-detachment model and the positive effect of recovery experience on health. Therefore, in practice, the role of supervisor behaviour for employees' psychological detachment should be addressed in management training courses.",
