    "Abstract": "Background: Workplaces are an important setting to deliver programs to reduce risk factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). To help decision makers understand the most current and relevant evidence regarding effectiveness of workplace programs, we conducted an umbrella review to present a comprehensive synthesis of the large volume of literature.Methods: Systematic reviews of workplace interventions targeting primary risk factors for NCDs-unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity, overweight/obesity, tobacco use, and/or excessive alcohol use-published since 2010 were sourced. For each risk factor, reviews were categorized by intervention type and quality. The most recent, high-quality review was included for each intervention type. Evidence for the effectiveness of each intervention type was then broadly classified based on the review summary findings.Results: Twenty-one reviews were included. Most reviews focused on diet (n = 5), physical activity (n = 7), or obesity (n = 9) interventions, with fewer targeting alcohol (n = 2) or tobacco (n = 2) use. Reviews of interventions focusing on individual behavior (such as education or counseling) were most common. Across diet, obesity, physical activity, and tobacco use, multicomponent interventions were consistently likely to be classified as likely effective. Motivational interviewing and broad health promotion interventions were identified as promising for alcohol use.Conclusion: This umbrella review identified that multicomponent workplace interventions were effective to reduce NCD risk factors. There is a gap around interventions targeting alcohol use as most syntheses lacked enough studies to draw conclusions about effectiveness. Exploring the impact of interventions that utilize policy and/or environmental strategies is a critical gap for future research.Key points center dot Much evidence exists demonstrating the effectiveness of workplace interventions targeting risk factors for noncommunicable diseases but the volume of research can make it difficult for decision makers to access the most relevant and high-quality research.center dot This umbrella review synthesizes the most current, high-quality systematic reviews that examine workplace interventions designed to address unhealthy diet, insufficient physical activity, obesity, alcohol use, and tobacco use.center dot Multicomponent interventions were rated as likely effective for most factors, although a lack of studies for some types of interventions meant that effectiveness was unable to be assessed, highlighting gaps for future research.",
