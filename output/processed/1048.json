    "Article Title": "Workplace bullying and mental health problems in balanced and gender-dominated workplaces",
    "Abstract": "We investigate risks of exposure to workplace bullying and related mental health outcomes for men and women when being in a gender minority as opposed to working in a gender-balanced working environment or when belonging to a gender majority. Based on a social identity perspective, we tested hypotheses about the risks of bullying and differences in the increase in mental health problems in a probability sample of the Swedish workforce in a prospective design. The results showed an increased risk of bullying and an increase in mental health problems as an outcome for men when in a gender minority, however, there were no corresponding risks for women. The risks for men were most obvious for person-related negative acts and for anxiety as an outcome. Social identity may clarify why a minority might be more at risk as well as the outcome it may lead to. Deviating from the group prototype may be perceived as a threat to the group alienating the target and opening up for sanctions. The observed gender differences may further be understood using social role theory. Men in female-dominated workplaces may deviate more from the expected traditional gender role and may be more susceptible to sanctions and suffer graver consequences as a result. The outcomes may be more severe if exposed to person-related acts compared to acts related to one's work.",
