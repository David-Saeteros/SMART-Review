    "Abstract": "Objective: This study compared two vocational programs: the About Face Vocational Program (AFVP), a traditional group-based vocational program created for formerly incarcerated veterans, and a hybrid program combining the AFVP with principles of individual placement and support-supported employment.Methods: The study evaluated 111 veterans with at least one felony conviction who had a mental illness, substance use disorder, or both. Veterans were randomly assigned to either vocational condition.Results: Veterans in the hybrid condition, compared with the AFVP alone, were more likely to find employment, had higher rates of full-time employment, and earned significantly more money over the course of the study. A comparison of only participants who found employment showed higher rates of full-time employment for veterans in the hybrid condition but similarities between the two groups in other measures of employment success.Conclusions: Blended models of vocational services for veterans with mental illness, substance use disorders, or both are effective at returning formerly incarcerated veterans to competitive employment.",
