    "Abstract": "ObjectiveThe Cancer Stories Study aimed to identify the factors that empower people who have experienced cancer. More specifically the project sought to explore the coping and support mechanisms people adopted to help understand and manage their cancer experience.MethodsA participatory research approach involved researchers and consumers working in partnership on the project. This research team agreed on a qualitative method that focused on cancer survivors' personal stories. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 cancer survivors in the lower half of the North Island, New Zealand (NZ). Generic qualitative analysis methods were employed including the recording, transcribing and thematic coding of interview narratives.ResultsSeven distinct themes were classified under the overarching theme of empowerment: attitude, change, family/whnau and friends, healthcare professionals and services, sources of support, employment and tangata whenua (NZ's indigenous peoples). The unique needs of each individual were strongly emphasised throughout all the themes indicating a one-size-fits-all' approach has its limitations. The need for improvements in communication, cultural and spiritual care was highlighted by many participants.ConclusionsIt is anticipated that this project will contribute to a greater understanding of the factors that might empower people in their cancer journey. An empowerment lens, that asks how those affected by cancer may be further enabled at an individual, family/whnau, employer and healthcare professional level may be useful in assisting people navigate and manage their cancer.
