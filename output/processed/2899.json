    "Article Title": "A New Era in Stress Monitoring: A Review of Embedded Devices and Tools for Detecting Stress in the Workplace",
    "Abstract": "Detection of stress and the development of innovative platforms for stress monitoring have attracted significant attention in recent years due to the growing awareness of the harmful effects of stress on mental and physical health. Stress is a widespread issue affecting individuals and often goes unnoticed as a health concern. It can lead to various negative physiological conditions, including anxiety, depression, cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairments. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of studies focusing on embedded devices for non-invasive stress detection, primarily in the form of a modified computer mouse or keyboard. This study not only fills a critical gap in the literature but also provides valuable insights into the design and implementation of hardware-based stress-detection methods. By focusing on embedded devices, specifically computer peripherals, this research highlights the potential for integrating stress monitoring into everyday workplace tools, thereby offering practical solutions for improving occupational health and well-being.",
