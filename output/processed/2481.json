    "Abstract": "Animal care workers in sheltering, rescue, and management are exposed to occupational stressors which negatively impact health. While the negative mental health impacts have been previously documented in this population, physical health, and its contributing factors, have not. This study investigated how job demands, job resources, and organisational justice relate to mental and physical health, and how they subsequently affect turnover intentions. Of the 285 participants, aged 19 to 94 years, who completed the online anonymous questionnaire, below average mental and physical health was reported. Mental health, but not physical health, was inversely related to intentions to leave. After controlling for age, hierarchical multiple regressions showed high emotional demands and direct euthanasia exposure significantly predicted poorer mental and physical health, while high levels of social support predicted better mental and physical health. No additional variance in either health domain was accounted for by organisational justice. It was concluded that both physical and mental health may be negatively impacted in those who work in shelter, rescue, and management environments which could lead to high turnover and poor outcomes for individuals and organisations. Monitoring through ongoing health records to enable early intervention and accommodations should be considered to promote the health of these workers.",
