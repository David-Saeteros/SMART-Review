    "Article Title": "Young Stroke Survivors' Preferred Methods of Meeting Their Unique Needs Shaping Better Care",
    "Abstract": "ObjectiveTo determine how young stroke survivors want their unmet needs to be addressed, we undertook an international online survey of people living with stroke.MethodsParticipants self-selected to complete an online survey that included a questionnaire on demographics and stroke-related characteristics, the Young Stroke Needs Screening Tool, and a questionnaire on how they wanted their needs to be met.ResultsOne hundred seventy-one responses were received (68% female respondents, mean age 45 years, interquartile range 36-51 years). Preferences for methods of meeting needs varied depending on the domain of need and participants' demographic and stroke-related characteristics. Face-to-face contact with a health care professional was a popular means of meeting needs, but methods outside of a traditional health care setting such as a succinct list of tips or peer support were widely acceptable and sometimes preferred.ConclusionThis work provides the impetus for developing alternative methods of meeting young stroke survivors' needs, many of which are not resource intensive or do not require an appointment with a health care professional.",
