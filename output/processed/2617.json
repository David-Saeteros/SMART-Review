    "Abstract": "While it has been shown that interrupting a person's sedentary behaviour has the potential to improve cognitive, physical and mental health, a large part of time that students spend in school is sedentary. As research has shown that approximately 80% of vocational education and training (VET) students have an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, implementing sit-to-stand (StS) desks could interrupt sedentary behaviour and promote healthier behaviour. Therefore, the acceptability and feasibility of using such desks in the VET setting should be investigated. Using semi-structured focus group interviews analysed via deductive content analysis, the opinions of 33 students for the following topics were assessed: (1) usage of the standing option of the desks (2) reasons for standing in class (3) experienced effect of standing behind the desk, and (4) fostering future StS desks usage. Although VET students are aware of the potential benefits of using StS desks, they need to be actively stimulated and motivated by teachers to use them. In addition, time is needed to get into the habit of standing. Thus, for successful implementation of StS desks in the VET setting, all stakeholders (i.e., students, teachers, schoolboards) should be actively involved in stimulating the healthy behaviour of VET students.",
