    "Article Title": "Increase in frailty of older workers and retirees predicted by negative psychosocial working conditions on the job",
    "Abstract": "Well-established evidence has shown that negative psychosocial working conditions adversely affect the health and well-being of prime-age workers, yet little is known about the consequences on the health of older workers. Our article examines the associations between declines in health in later life, measured as frailty, and negative psychosocial working conditions, and considers the role of retirement. We use longitudinal cross-national data collected by SHARE I and SHARE IV and focus on the respondents who were working at baseline. We find that low reward, high effort, effort to reward ratio, and effort to control ratio were all predictors of increasing frailty. The association between low reward and change in frailty was modified by retirement status at follow-up, with nonretired respondents in low-reward jobs experiencing the largest increases in frailty at follow-up. These results suggest that the effect of psychosocial working conditions on physical health may extend well past the prime working age, and retirement may have a protective effect on the health of older workers in low reward jobs.
