    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of the study is to review evidence of the negative consequences of international economic sanctions on population health in Iran and pathways via which the sanctions affect health.Study design: This is a narrative review.Methods: Data from the World Bank and the Central Bank of Iran were gathered to clarify economic consequences of sanctions. Moreover, the literature was reviewed for published data on health consequences of economic sanctions in Iran and economic crisis in other parts of the world. Finally, some mechanisms via which economic sanctions could affect health were reviewed.Results: Iran experienced 11.8% reduction in gross domestic production growth in 2012 compared with 2011, besides 40% inflation and 200% depreciation of Iranian currency. Ultimately, it resulted in increased living costs and unemployment. One year after termination of sanctions, Iran's gross domestic production growth increased by 14.1% in 2016. Data revealed that mental health has been affected during sanctions. Moreover, access to essential and lifesaving medication has been compromised, similar to other countries during economic recession.Conclusion: Economic sanctions have had negative consequences on population health in Iran by impairing social determinants of health and access to medication and care. These sanctions widen economic inequality and health gap. (c) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
