    "Abstract": "Background. - Determine the needs for medical follow-up by occupational medicine among Medicine students. Collect their feelings about their studies, know their point of view and their knowledge about occupational medicine and finally improve the medical follow-up of externs in order to limit psycho-social risks. Method. - This was an analytical, cohort, retrospective, single-center, epidemiological obser-vational study. Between February 2020 and September 2020, Medicine students from 4th to 6th year of the studies completed a questionnaire specifically created for the study including the HAD depression questionnaire. Results. - Among the 494 participating students, the lack of recognition at work was declared by 94%, the fact of having made sacrifices to continue medicine by 85%. They were 43% not to recommend their studies to high school students and 24% would not return to medicine. Anxiety, chronic fatigue, work overload and sleep disturbances affected 82%, 70%, 65% and 41% of students, respectively, and 31% saw a specialist to discuss their studies. Substance consump-tion to support studies was reported by 18% of students. Finally, 71% found that occupational health follow-up was inadequate or non-existent. They felt that the lack of time and the lack of knowledge of the role of occupational medicine limited follow-up. Conclusions. - Occupational medicine is an important part of monitoring the health of medical students. The employment visit will be extremely important in the care of the students. This survey showed that there was still a lot of discomfort among students, that they still face many difficulties. The psycho-social risks appear early in medical studies and it is important to act as soon as possible. The setting up of information sessions between classes, flyers or posters to communicate on the role and missions of the service will allow students to be informed.",
