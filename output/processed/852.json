    "Article Title": "Perspectives on Employer-Initiated Terminations Among Young Adults on the Autism Spectrum",
    "Abstract": "Job instability is high among autistic adults, with employer-initiated terminations a common reason for job loss. The current study used qualitative methods to code reasons that autistic adults identified for their employer-initiated termination. From 315 autistic individuals ages 18-35 who completed an online survey, 93 (29.5%) reported having been terminated from a job. These individuals were asked about the reasons for their termination and responses were coded into thematic categories. Common reasons included work performance, social difficulties, attendance, and mental health challenges. Adults were more likely to attribute terminations to internal causes (related to the individual) than to external causes (environment-related). A good fit between workplace, individual preferences, skills, and abilities is likely key to promoting job continuity for autistic adults.",
