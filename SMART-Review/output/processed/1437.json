    "Abstract": "Purpose: Published studies have revealed challenges for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) living in rural areas compared to those in urban areas, such as poor access to HIV care, insufficient transportation, and isolation. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between population density and multiple psychosocial and clinical outcomes in the largest cohort of women with HIV (WWH) in the United States.Methods: Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) participants from Southern sites (n = 561) in 2013-2018 were categorized and compared by population density quartiles. The most urban quartile was compared with the most rural quartile in several psychosocial and clinical variables, including HIV viral load suppression, HIV medication adherence, HIV care attendance, depression, internalized HIV stigma, and perceived discrimination in healthcare settings.Results: Although women in the lowest density quartile were unexpectedly more highly resourced, women in that quartile had greater odds of not attending an HIV care visit in the last six months (odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.43-0.95]), yet higher odds for having fully suppressed HIV when compared to women in the highest density quartile (OR = 1.64, 95% CI [1.13-2.38]). Highly urban WWH had greater likelihood of unsuppressed HIV, even after controlling for income, employment, and health insurance, despite reporting greater HIV care adherence and similar medication adherence.Discussion: Further investigation into the reasons for these disparities by population density is needed, and particular clinical attention should be focused on individuals from high population density areas to help maximize their health outcomes.",
