    "Article Title": "A 2024 NATIONWIDE CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF CIGARETTE SMOKING E-CIGARETTE USE AND HEATED TOBACCO USE IN POLAND",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: Monitoring tobacco use is one of the most important tobacco control interventions recommended by the World Health Organization. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and heated tobacco use in a nationwide sample of adults in Poland, as well as to identify factors associated with smoking, e-cigarette use, and heated tobacco use. Material and Methods: This nationwide crosssectional survey was carried out in February 2-4, 2024 using the computer-assisted web interviewing method. The study questionnaire included 17 closed questions on smoking, e-cigarette use, and heated tobacco use. A sample of 1080 adults was selected using a non-probability quota sampling method. Results: Data were collected from 1080 adults, age M +/- SD 48.4 +/- 15.5 years, 53% females. Past 30-day smoking was declared by 30.4% of adults in Poland, including 24.5% of daily smokers. Ever e-cigarette use was declared by 33% of respondents, and 20.6% had ever tried heated tobacco. Past 30-day e-cigarette use was declared by 15.2% of adults, wherein 5.9% were daily e-cigarette users. Past 30-day heated tobacco use was declared by 10.9% of respondents, wherein 4.9% were daily heated tobacco users. One-tenth of adults were dual users (cigarette and e-cigarette or heated tobacco), and 6.5% were past 30-day triple users. Age 40-59 years, having less than higher education, and bad economic status were significantly associated with daily smoking (p < 0.05). Age 18-39 years, having less than higher education, and active occupational status (employment/self-employment) were associated with daily e-cigarette use (p < 0.05). Age 18-39 years and active occupational status were associated with daily heated tobacco use (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides comprehensive epidemiological data on the current prevalence of smoking, e-cigarette use, and heated tobacco use. The introduction of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products evoked changes in social behaviors related to nicotine use. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2024;37(3):271-86",
