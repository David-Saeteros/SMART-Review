    "Abstract": "Accessible SummaryWhat is known on the subject?A search of common databases indicates the absence of any research focused on the needs of Iranian women diagnosed with severe mental illness post-discharge from an inpatient setting.Moreover, there is a lacuna of information about the unique experiences and needs of persons diagnosed with severe mental illness living in non-Western communities (esp. Middle Eastern communities).What this paper adds to existing knowledgeThis study examined interviews of women diagnosed with severe mental illness receiving treatment at an Iranian inpatient hospital. Three categories of post-discharge needs emerged: support, skill acquisition and information.Support consisted of family, social and health system subcategories. Skill acquisition was comprised of social skills, work skills and self-management skills. Lastly, information distinguished between illness-related information and women's health information.What are the implications for practice?Findings highlight the need for systemic changes to current care models. Broadly, families should be incorporated into care to improve outcomes and decrease stigma. Regarding mental health nursing, results highlighted the need for additional nursing and occupational therapy interventions to empower families and patients. Nursing practitioners can aid in preparing these patients for employment and public health initiatives to decrease stigma and improve access to care.IntroductionUnderstanding the post-discharge needs of patients diagnosed with severe mental illness is critical for improving treatment outcomes.AimThe aim of the present study was to determine the unique post-discharge needs of Iranian women diagnosed with severe mental illness.MethodConventional content analysis was utilized to analyse data gathered via focus group interviews conducted within the psychiatric inpatient unit at Farabi hospital located in Kermanshah, Iran. Participants (N = 42; M age = 40; SD = 6.3 years) had been diagnosed with a severe mental illness, had a history of at least two psychiatric hospitalizations and were awaiting discharge following significant symptom improvement.ResultsContent analysis extracted three categories of post-discharge needs: support, skill acquisition and information. Support consisted of family, social and health system subcategories. Skill acquisition was comprised of social skills, work skills and self-management skills. Lastly, information distinguished between illness-related information and women's health information.Discussion/Implications for practiceAnalysis of interview data highlighted the general need for adopting a family-system approach to reduce stigma, increase knowledge and foster skill acquisition. Regarding mental health nursing, results highlighted the unique role of nurses and their capacity to pre-emptively address needs such as aiding in employment. Lastly, findings are contrasted against Western care models.",
