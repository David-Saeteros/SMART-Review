    "Article Title": "The clinical profile of employees with mental health problems working in social firms in the UK",
    "Abstract": "Background: UK social firms are under-researched but are a potentially important vocational option for people with mental health problems.Aims: To describe the clinical profile, satisfaction levels and experiences of social firms employees with mental health problems.Method: Clinical, work and service use characteristics were collected from social firms' employees with mental health problems in England and Wales. Workplace experience and satisfaction were explored qualitatively.Results: Predominantly, social firms' employees (N=80) report that they have a diagnosis of depression (56%) and anxiety (41%). People with schizophrenia (20%) or bipolar disorder (5%) were a minority. Respondents had low symptom and disability levels, high quality of life and job satisfaction and experienced reductions in secondary mental health service use over time. High-workplace satisfaction was related to flexibility, manager and colleague support and workplace accommodations.Conclusions: The clinical profile, quality of life and job satisfaction level of employees with mental health problems suggest social firms could be a useful addition to UK vocational services for some people. Current employees mainly have common mental disorders, and social firms will need to shift their focus if they are to form a substantial pathway for the vocational recovery of people currently using community mental health teams.",
