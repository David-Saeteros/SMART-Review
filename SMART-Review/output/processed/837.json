    "Abstract": "Purpose: People living with epilepsy (PLWE) have a higher prevalence of mental health comorbidities and poorer psychosocial outcomes compared to the general population. The aim of this study was to examine psychosocial outcomes, mental health, healthcare accessibility, and seizure burden in PLWE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults with epilepsy treated in an urban multicenter health system from 2021 to 2022. A standardized questionnaire assessed for COVID-19 history, comorbidities, access to antiseizure medications (ASMs) and neurological care, seizure burden, and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., employment, social and financial support). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were administered to evaluate for depression and anxiety. Frequency and proportions for categorical variables and median and interquartile ranges for continuous variables were calculated. Results: Fifty-five PLWE participated (95 % response rate). Median age was 40 years (IQR 31.5-66.5), 61.8 % were women, 47.3 % had a bachelor's degree or higher and 29.1 % each had Medicaid and Medicare insurance. Race (from highest to lowest %) was: 32.7 % White, 20 % Black, 20 % Latinx, 14.5 % Asian, and 12.7 % selected other or prefer not to say. COVID-19 had been diagnosed in 21.8 % of participants. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were self-reported by 43.6 % and 34.5 % of patients, respectively, with many describing this symptom as new post-pandemic (37.5 % and 31.6 %, respectively). Using validated scales, 52.7 % had depression (PHQ-9 score >= 5) with 30.9 % having moderate/severe depression (PHQ-9 score >= 10), while 29.1 % had probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7 score >= 8). Seizure burden increased in 21.8 % of participants, while 20 % reported fewer seizures and 29.1 % were seizure free since the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic impacts of the pandemic included job loss (25 % amongst those employed at onset of pandemic), new or worsened financial difficulties (40 %), and new or worsened social support issues (30.9 %). Of all participants, 18.2 % reported difficulties accessing ASMs and 25.5 % cancelled visits, but of those with cancelled visits, 78.6 % had their appointments rescheduled as a telehealth visit. Conclusion: Our cohort of PLWE experienced some challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic including poorer mental health and financial and employment-related stressors. Encouragingly, healthcare access was relatively spared during the COVID-19 crisis, with some patients even reporting a reduction in seizure burden. However, PLWE require ongoing psychosocial support with particular attention to decompensation of mental health and social stressors that may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
