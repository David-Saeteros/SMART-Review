    "Article Title": "Vocational Rehabilitation Service Utilization and Employment Outcomes Among Secondary Students on the Autism Spectrum",
    "Abstract": "U.S. policy interventions encourage earlier provision of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services to support students and youth with disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during the transition from school to work. We analyzed Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA-911) data using multivariable logistic regression to determine the association of VR services receipt with employment outcomes for students ages 16-21, same-age non-student youth and young adults with ASD. Students with autism received job-related services (job search, job placement, and on-the-job supports) at rates significantly below comparison groups, even though odds of successful employment at VR exit were significantly higher if they received these services. Findings suggest that rates of employment among students with autism might be improved with intentional delivery of job-related services.",
