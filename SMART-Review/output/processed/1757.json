    "Article Title": "Prospective Associations of Leisure-Time Physical Activity With Psychological Distress and Well-Being: A 12-Year Cohort Study",
    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to investigate the associations of leisure-time physical activity with psychological distress and well-being, and potential mediators. Methods We used data from the 1970 British Cohort Study (n = 5197; 2688 men), including waves 34y (2004), 42y (2012), and 46y (2016). Participants reported leisure-time physical activity frequency and intensity (exposure) at age 34 years (baseline); cognition (vocabulary test), body mass index, disability, mobility and pain perception (potential mediators) at age 42 years; and psychological distress (Malaise Inventory) and well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh scale) at age 46 years. Baseline confounders included sex, country, education, employment status, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, and psychological distress. Main analyses included logistic regression and mediation models. Results Higher leisure-time physical activity intensity at baseline was associated with lower psychological distress at 46y (beta = -0.038 [95% confidence interval {CI} =-0.069 to -0.007]), but not leisure-time physical activity frequency. Baseline leisure-time physical activity frequency and intensity were associated with higher psychological well-being at 46y (frequency: beta = 0.089 [95% CI = 0.002 to 0.176]; intensity: beta = 0.262 [95% CI = 0.123 to 0.401]); and total: beta = 0.041 [95% CI = 0.013 to 0.069]). Only body mass index at 42y partially mediated the association between leisure-time physical activity frequency (15.7%) and total leisure-time physical activity (6.2%) at 34y, with psychological well-being at 46y. Conclusions Our findings highlight the role of leisure-time physical activity in psychological distress and well-being, with greater effect sizes associated with higher frequency and intensity of leisure-time physical activity. Future interventions should consider examining potential mediators of the association of leisure-time physical activity with psychological well-being, such as body mass index.",
