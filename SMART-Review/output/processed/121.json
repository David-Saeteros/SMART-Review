    "Abstract": "Disability due to mental health problems places a significant burden on both society and the individual. Occu-pational health professionals play a key role in promoting mental health in collaboration with workplaces. Our study focused on the joint preventive mental health practices of workplaces and occupational health services (OHS). We used a multiple method approach. We gathered data in parallel from September to October 2021 through an online survey and a workshop of 102 participants. The survey was sent to 25 workplaces and their OHS (N = 25), and assessed employee perceptions of collaboration in mental health practices. We set no exclusion criteria and included all responses. We used Fisher's Exact Test in the statistical analysis. We studied 140 comments on the means of the mental health support obtained in the workshop, using content analysis. The survey response rate was 78 % (N = 39). The OHS providers (N = 15) claimed that mental health support was being provided through collaboration, and 74 % (N = 24) of the workplaces agreed. Content analysis streamlined collaboration methods into six upper categories: by (1) Planning measures together, (2) Strengthening em-ployees' resources, (3) Discussing work ability, (4) Providing supervisors/managers with support, (5) Discussing and collaborating, and (6) Clarifying responsibilities and roles in the support of mental health. We found 55 different practices for streamlining collaboration between workplaces and OHS. We conclude that the practices to promote mental health through collaboration between workplaces and OHS require joint planning.",
