    "Article Title": "Longitudinal outcomes of a work inclusion program in mental health departments in the city of Milan",
    "Abstract": "Background: Work functioning impairment is a key diagnostic and prognostic criterion in patients with psychiatric disorders and work inclusion is a major goal of their therapeutic pathway. Since 2009, the Regional Innovative Program (PIR) TR106, promoted by ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco of Milan in collaboration with other Departments of Mental Health and Addictions (DSMDs) in the town of Milan (Italy), has been developing the employment inclusion of psychiatric patients. Aims: The objective of this study is to evaluate its outcomes over 8 years of observation. Method: We reported the results of a retrospective epidemiologic analysis on 2,142 interventions on 1,066 patients recruited, investigating PIR TR106 outcomes per year focusing on different subgroups. We focused on 'positive', 'negative', and 'other' outcomes. Results: We preliminary calculated job maintenance interventions (5%, 107) and excluded these interventions from the overall. We observed 29 job firing (1.4%) and 15 job resignations (0.7%) as negative results (equal to 2.2% of the total) and 388 job hiring (16.6%), 647 traineeships (31.8%), and 413 work formation (20.3%) as positive outcomes (equal to 68.75%). In other outcomes (29.1%) we found 305 dismissals from PIR TR 106 (15%) and transitory outcomes (14.1%). Job hiring increased from 8.9% in 2012 to 23.8 % in 2019 (p < .001), while the dismissals diminished from 26.7% to 13.3% (p < .001). The effectiveness of traineeships in terms of job hiring increased in the ratio of annual job hiring versus job traineeship (+48.8%). The majority of hired patients (15.1%) were affected by a psychotic disorder. A significant hiring increase was observed in patients with psychotic disorders and personality disorders (p < .005). Results: We preliminary calculated job maintenance interventions (5%, 107) and excluded these interventions from the overall. We observed 29 job firing (1.4%) and 15 job resignations (0.7%) as negative results (equal to 2.2% of the total) and 388 job hiring (16.6%), 647 traineeships (31.8%), and 413 work formation (20.3%) as positive outcomes (equal to 68.75%). In other outcomes (29.1%) we found 305 dismissals from PIR TR 106 (15%) and transitory outcomes (14.1%). Job hiring increased from 8.9% in 2012 to 23.8 % in 2019 (p < .001), while the dismissals diminished from 26.7% to 13.3% (p < .001). The effectiveness of traineeships in terms of job hiring increased in the ratio of annual job hiring versus job traineeship (+48.8%). The majority of hired patients (15.1%) were affected by a psychotic disorder. A significant hiring increase was observed in patients with psychotic disorders and personality disorders (p < .005). Conclusions: PIR-TR106 represents a territorial employment inclusion program with progressively increasing effectiveness and specificity, as suggested by changes in outcomes during the 8-year observation. The adaptive capacity and sustainability of the intervention are worth further investigation.",
