    "Article Title": "Psychological Impact of Bladder Cancer: Insights from 219 Patients and Caregivers in Indonesia Using DASS-21 (2019-2023)",
    "Abstract": "Background: Bladder cancer (BC) is a common disease worldwide. Low survival rates and high recurrence lead to the risk of mental disorders. This study analyzed 219 patients with bladder cancer using the Indonesian Version of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and related factors. Material/Methods: This cross-sectional study included 219 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer during 2019-2023 in a referral hospital in Indonesia. Data were collected using a questionnaire that assessed the characteristics of the patients and a DASS-21 questionnaire. Results: Some patients and caregivers experienced depression, stress, and anxiety. The percentage of caregivers who experienced anxiety was higher than for patients (47.9% vs 45.7%). Statistical analysis showed that age, income, and marital status were associated with the incidence of depression (p=0.000, p=0.001, and p=0.000, respectively), anxiety (p=0.000, p=0.012, and p=0.001, respectively), and stress (p=0.000, p=0.007, and p=0.000, respectively). Routes of patient admission (p=0.043, respectively) and employment status (p=0.005, respectively) were associated with the incidence of depression in patients (p=0.043, respectively). Employment status was also associated with stress in patients (p=0.038, respectively). Statistical analysis of caregivers found that routes of patient admission and marital status were related to the incidence of depression among caregivers (p=0.036 and p=0.007, respectively). Conclusions: Monitoring and providing support for patients and caregivers are needed to prevent poor prognosis due to psychological problems, including paying attention to sociodemographic factors.",
