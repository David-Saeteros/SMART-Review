    "Abstract": "Introduction Mental health settings are potentially high-stress workplaces that can lead to nurses' poorer health and well-being. Resilience programmes are a strengths-based preventative approach for promoting mental health and well-being in the face of adversity; however, there is no prior research on mental health nurses' perspectives on resilience programmes.Aim To explore the perspectives of mental health nurses participating in a mental health service-initiated resilience programme (Promoting Adult Resilience).Method An exploratory qualitative inquiry was undertaken. Multiple qualitative data: open-ended responses and semi-structured interviews and focus groups, were thematically analysed.Results Twenty-nine registered nurses from a metropolitan mental health service participated. Four main themes were as follows: being confronted by adversity; reinforcing understandings of resilience; strengthening resilience; and applying resilience skills at work.Discussion This is the first study to report mental health nurses' perspectives on a resilience programme. Resilience programmes can help improve nurses' self-efficacy and ability to realistically appraise stressful situations and to moderate their emotional responses to others.Implications for practice It is recommended resilience programmes are provided to promote nurses' well-being and resilient practices. To build a resilient workforce, the wider barriers and risks to staff well-being need to be addressed at a unit, organizational and professional level.",
