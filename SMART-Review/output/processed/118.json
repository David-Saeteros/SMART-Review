    "Abstract": "This study aimed to examine the association between vocational rehabilitation (VR) services and employment outcomes of people with epilepsy (PWE), after controlling for demographic covariates. Data was retrieved from the Rehabilitation Services Administration Case Service Report (RSA-911) database for fiscal year (FY) 2011. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict employment outcomes of PWE. Of the 2030 previously unemployed PWE who received services, 884 (43.5%) achieved successful competitive employment. Results indicate that higher education level and cost of VR services consumed were positively related to successful employment. In contrast, having co-occurring anxiety/depression, receiving cash benefits, or increasing time spent in the VR system was negatively associated with employment. Eight specific VR services (e.g., education, vocational training, and job search and placement assistance) were also found to be significant predictors of employment. Services provided by state VR agencies were proven to be beneficial in improving employment outcomes. PWE should be encouraged to pursue VR services to increase the chances of attaining employment. Health care providers should also become familiar with the array of VR services. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

The study is set in the US and covers the timeframe of 2011, which is within the specified range. The intervention is vocational rehabilitation services, which is one of the included interventions. The population is people with epilepsy, who have documented mental health problems, meeting the population criteria. The outcomes include employment outcomes such as employment rates and job duration.",
