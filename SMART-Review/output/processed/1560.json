    "Article Title": "Psychological Distress in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Over the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "Abstract": "Background This study sought to better understand the experiences of adults with congenital heart disease throughout the pandemic. Objectives were to determine (1) psychological distress before and throughout the pandemic; (2) changes in day-to-day functioning; and (3) the percentage of adults with congenital heart disease who experienced COVID-19 related symptoms, underwent testing, and tested positive. Methods and Results This was a cross-sectional study paired with retrospective chart review. A web-based survey was distributed to patients between December 2020 and January 2021. Patients reported on psychological distress across 5 categories (Screening Tool for Psychological Distress; depression, anxiety, stress, anger, and lack of social support), whether they experienced symptoms of COVID-19 and/or sought testing, and changes to their work and social behavior. Five hundred seventy-nine survey responses were received, of which 555 were linked to clinical data. Patients were aged 45 +/- 15 years. The proportion of patients reporting above-threshold values for all Screening Tool for Psychological Distress items significantly increased during the early pandemic compared with before the pandemic. Stress returned to baseline in December 2020/January 2021, whereas all others remained elevated. Psychological distress decreased with age, and women reported persistently elevated stress and anxiety compared with men during the pandemic. A consistent trend was not observed with regard to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association anatomic and physiologic classification. Fifty (9%) patients lost employment because of a COVID-19-related reason. COVID-19 symptoms were reported by 145 (25%) patients, 182 (31%) sought testing, and 10 (2%) tested positive. Conclusions A substantial proportion of adults with congenital heart disease reported clinically significant psychological distress during the pandemic.",
