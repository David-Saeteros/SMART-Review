    "Abstract": "The growth of the peer workforce in behavioral health services is bringing opportunities to organizations and institutions that serve people living with mental and substance use disorders and their families. Peer workers are defined as people in recovery from mental illness or substance use disorders or both that possess specific peer support competencies. Similar roles are identified for families of people in recovery. Peer support has been implemented in a vast range of behavioral health services, including in the relatively new use of peer support in criminal justice and emergency service environments. Behavioral health services are striving to integrate peer workers into their workforce to augment existing service delivery, in part because peer support has demonstrated effectiveness in helping people with behavioral health conditions to connect to, engage in, and be active participants in treatment and recovery support services across all levels of care. This article describes the experiences that organizations and their workforce, including peer workers, encounter as they integrate peer support services into the array of behavioral health services. Specific attention is given to the similarities and differences of services provided by peers in mental health settings and substance use settings, and implications for future directions. The article also addresses the role of peer workers in integrated behavioral and physical healthcare services. (C) 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.",
