    "Abstract": "Purpose: Youth who are Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) are at risk for numerous long-term occupational, social, and mental health-related sequelae. The aim of the present study was to investigate mediated pathways from early life risk factors to NEET status in early adulthood, with a particular focus on the role of the family environment during adolescence. Methods: Participants were 6,403 respondents from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, who were aged 10-11 years in cycles 1 (1994-1995) to 4 (2000-2001). Parents reported on indicators of early life adversity as well as parent-child conflict at age 12-13. Adolescents reported on their mental health and behaviour at age 14-15. NEET status was assessed at age 24 using tax information from the linked T1 Family File. Indirect pathways from childhood exposures, through adolescent factors, to NEET status in young adulthood were assessed via mediation analysis. Results: At age 10/11, living with a single parent, low household income, stressful life events, and having a parent with a chronic condition were associated with greater likelihood of being NEET at age 24; parents' social support was negatively associated with NEET. These associations were mediated through parental depression at age 10/11, parent-child conflict at age 12/13, and adolescent mental health and behaviour at age 14/15. Discussion: Our results add to a large body of literature linking family stressors, parental depression, parent-child interaction, and adolescent behaviour symptoms, suggesting a chain of influence through these factors toward young adult marginalization from the labour market.
