    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unemployment is high not only among people with mental illness, but also among young adults in general. The combination of having a severe mental illness and being young entails a particularly problematic situation for young people with psychosis. This study aimed to understand how this group envision their future possibilities for entering the labour market or engaging in other productive activities.OBJECTIVE: To explore how young adults with psychosis perceive their possibilities, wishes and support needs for gaining employment or engaging in other productive activities.METHODS: A descriptive design with qualitative individual in-depth interviews was used. Eighteen young adults with psychosis, aged 18-30 years, were interviewed. Data was analysed with qualitative content analysis.RESULTS: Four categories based on the experiences of the participants as being vital for having work or other productive activities were generated: Wishing for a role in the community, Being my own coach, Needing personal support and Having a supportive workplace. Each of them included sub-categories.CONCLUSION: The young adults with psychosis were a long way from having paid work, but they desired to have a worker role in the community. They are a heterogeneous group, which entails that it is important that professionals and employers have a person-centered and holistic approach, listening to the individuals themselves.",
