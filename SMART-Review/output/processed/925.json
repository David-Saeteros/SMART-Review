    "Abstract": "Increased levels of burnout have been demonstrated for providers serving individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Given higher levels of burnout are linked with a number of negative physical and psychological outcomes, it is important to understand predictors of burnout to inform prevention and intervention strategies. Leiter and Maslach (1999) provide a framework for conceptualizing burnout within an organizational context according to six areas of work-life. The present study examines the relation between the six areas of work-life and burnout in staff providing direct care services to individuals with ASD. A total of 149 providers completed an online survey consisting of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Maslacl- Jackson, & Leiter, 1997), the Areas of Work-life Survey (AWS; Leiter & Maslach, 1999), and additional questions about training and supervision. The areas of workload, reward, fairness, and values emerged as the best predictors of burnout. While workload, fairness, and values predicted emotional exhaustion, values and reward predicted personal accomplishment, and values alone predicted depersonalization. Lower levels of training satisfaction and frequency of supervision were related to burnout. Findings provide direction regarding which aspects of the workplace may be most relevant for this workforce and how these areas may be targeted for change.",
