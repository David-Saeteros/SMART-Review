    "Article Title": "The Blaufeuer measure for employees with mental stress and simultaneous workplace problems-Is the target group being reached?",
    "Abstract": "BackgroundEmployees with mental burden and simultaneous workplace problems have an increased risk of chronification and disability pension. To support this group of people, the German Pension Insurance (Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund) developed the Systemic Integration Management for People with Mental Impairments (SEMpsych) project as part of the rehapro federal program. The Blaufeuer counselling service was implemented in three model regions (Berlin, Cologne, and Nuremberg). The measure usually comprises up to 12 counselling sessions in 12 months. This article describes the characteristics of the participants and examines whether they belong to the intended target group. MethodDuring September 2020 and June 2022, the participants completed a questionnaire between the first and second counselling sessions. Socio-demographic-, clinical- and work-related variables were assessed. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals. ResultsData from n = 482 participants (66.4% female; MAge = 45.2 years (+/- 10.2 years); 64.1% working full-time; 49.8% currently on sick leave) were included. The participants have high psychological impairments (e.g. PHQ-9: M = 14.6 (+/- 5.4)) and low subjective work ability (e.g. WAS: M = 3.2 (+/- 2.6)). Most participants report overload at work and problems with superiors. DiscussionParticipants exhibit mental burden values that correspond to those of patients at the beginning of outpatient psychotherapy or the first contact in an inpatient psychiatric clinic. Blaufeuer addresses a highly stressed group of people who have not yet received adequate treatment. Further studies on process and outcome evaluation will follow.",
