    "Article Title": "'My Journey': A Qualitative Study of Recovery From the Perspective of Individuals With Chronic Mental Illness",
    "Abstract": "Due to the humanistic paradigm shift in recent years, mental health recovery has been approached through personal recovery beyond the limits of the biomedical perspective, emphasising the subjective perception and uniqueness of the individual. Therefore, approaching recovery perceptions from patients' perspectives has gained importance. This study aimed to examine in depth the recovery perceptions of individuals with chronic mental illness. It is a qualitative study conducted using a phenomenological design. The study group consisted of 12 patients who had been undergoing treatment for mental illness for at least 1 year and were selected by purposive sampling method. Data were collected face-to-face using a semi-structured interview form and analysed using the content analysis technique. The content analysis revealed three main themes and seven sub-themes. The themes were journey (a meaningful life, optimal functioning, new identity), journey ticket (resilience, support systems) and stones on the road (traditional perspective, barriers). In conclusion, the study results revealed that individuals in the recovery process required support and counselling to make sense of the process and adapt their identity. Employment should be used more effectively in the recovery process of individuals with chronic mental illness. Recovery can only be achieved by breaking away from the traditional perspective of healing and combating the perception of society towards patients. Accordingly, psychiatric nurses should provide effective guidance and counselling to show that individuals can create and live a meaningful life alongside their illnesses.",
