    "Abstract": "Objective: This article reports on the current state of psychiatric rehabilitation in Portugal. Method: A paper-and-pencil survey was sent to 70 institutions to inquire about the provision of psychiatric rehabilitation services and programs. Results: With a response rate of 40%, 14% of institutions indicated that supported education was provided, 36% offered nonmainstream vocational training, and 29% provided supported employment; none provided evidence-based Individual Placement and Support. Permanent group homes in the community (29%) followed by transitional group homes on institutional grounds (18%) were the most common residential services, with supported housing services (14%) offered less frequently. Finally, 93% of institutions offered occupational activities, 61% provided multifamily psychoeducation, and 36% provided single-family psychoeducation. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Despite recent national initiatives promoting effective psychiatric rehabilitation services, supported employment, supported education, and supported housing are not widely implemented in Portugal. To achieve better outcomes for clients, it is critical that evidence-based and promising practices be extensively disseminated.",
