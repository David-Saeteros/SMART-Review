    "Abstract": "ObjectiveThe study was aimed at investigating the association between postpartum women's breastfeeding self-efficacy levels and their depression levels, social support levels, and breastfeeding attitudes in early postpartum period.MethodsThe cross-sectional study was carried out in Kirklareli in Turkey. The population of the study consisted of 398 women aged 15-49 in the first 42 days of the postpartum period who presented to eight family health centers. The study data were collected face-to-face using the Personal Information Form, Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Breastfeeding Attitudes of the Evaluation Scale (BAES).ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 28.61 +/- 5.72 (Min:18, Max: 44), and the mean score they obtained from the BSES-SF was 55.13 +/- 8.39. Statistically significant differences were detected between the participants' BSES-SF scores and age groups, employment status, perceived income level, and the number of living children (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected between marital status, educational status and BSES-SF scores (p > 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis adjusted according to the sociodemographic characteristics, BAES, EPDS and MSPSS accounted for 48.3% of the BSES-SF. A negative association was found between BSES-SF scores and EPDS scores (beta = -0.178, 95% CI:-0.349, -0.006), and a positive relation between the BAES scores (beta = 0.194, 95% CI: 0.163, 0.226) and the MSPSS scores (beta = 0.114, 95% CI: 0.037, 0.191).ConclusionAs the level of depression of women increases in the postpartum period, the level of breastfeeding self-efficacy decreases. The breastfeeding self-efficacy increases as the level of social support increases and as the attitudes that drive breastfeeding behavior change positively.",
