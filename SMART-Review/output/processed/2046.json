    "Article Title": "What is the personal experience of jobseekers with severe mental illness undertaking a cognitive remediation program?",
    "Abstract": "Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) can enhance their occupational outcomes by engaging with a comprehensive support team, which might include both cognitive and vocational support. To date, there have been no reports of the personal experience of individuals undertaking such interventions.Aims: This study aimed to explore the subjective experience of participating in cognitive remediation (CR), as an adjunctive treatment to illness-self management psycho-education for jobseekers (HOPE).Methods: Thirteen jobseekers with SMI, who had completed a CR program of 20 hours duration, in addition to a 20 hours of the HOPE program, responded to an individual semi-structured interview concerning their experience of the program. Data were analysed using content analysis.Results: Feedback was predominantly positive. Participants described CR as a beneficial experience in improving their intrinsic (e.g. self-efficacy, motivation), cognitive and social functioning. It also revealed aspects to be addressed.Conclusions: This study highlights the positive potential of this type of intervention, but also reveals the barriers that people with SMI may confront including the lack of CR availability and vocational/personal support. It is hoped that this study will assist in generating evidence on effective ways to improve the current CR approach. (C) 2016 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid.
