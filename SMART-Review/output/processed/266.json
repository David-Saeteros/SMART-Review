    "Article Title": "High-ACE Low Wage Workers Occupational Health Nursing Research and Praxis Through a Trauma-Informed Lens",
    "Abstract": "Individuals with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) disproportionately have poor mental and physical health outcomes. These experiences affect individuals across the life span extending beyond health with deleterious impact on work-related outcomes. Low-wage workers are particularly at risk. Social service and health organizations are becoming aware of the extent to which the populations they serve have been affected by these experiences. Employment support programs may serve high-ACE individuals but likely are unaware of their histories and the developmental or health deficits that result and can impinge on successful employment. Occupational health nurses may be well-positioned not only to implement trauma-informed care in workplaces but also to influence the ways in which employment services for this vulnerable group are delivered. The purpose of this article is to consider how ACEs could affect vulnerable workers. The need for trauma-informed research and praxis to advance occupational health nursing is discussed.",
