    "Article Title": "Rehabilitation scholarship program: A solution to personnel shortages in the vocational rehabilitation system",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The capacity for individuals with disabilities to work has been proven through multiple initiatives and demonstration projects; however, personnel shortages within the vocational rehabilitation (VR) system impact service delivery to consumers. Long-Term Training Programs (LTTP) in rehabilitation counseling address the priority of increasing the number of highly qualified rehabilitation professionals available to serve VR consumers.OBJECTIVE: This article describes a five-year LTTP in a Rehabilitation and Mental Health Counseling (RMHC) program at a large Southeastern University. The goal of this program is to increase the skills of rehabilitation counseling scholars so that, upon successful completion of the program, they are prepared to effectively meet the VR needs of persons with disabilities.CONCLUSIONS: The RMHC scholar program is achieving the stated objective by offering didactic and practical training at the master's level through its accredited program. New courses have been developed to increase scholars' exposure to current trends and best practices in rehabilitation counseling such as customized employment strategies, case management and documentation, critical thinking and collaborative relationships. This article includes an overview of the scholarship program and lessons learned to assist other programs in replication. Implications for the field are also included.",
