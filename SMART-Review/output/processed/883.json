    "Article Title": "Suicidal Ideation among Florida National Guard Members: Combat Deployment and Non-Deployment Risk and Protective Factors",
    "Abstract": "This study examined relationships among risk/protective factors and suicidal ideation (SI) in deployed and non-deployed National Guard members, particularly examining for possible differential effects of deployment on SI. A total of 3,098 Florida National Guard members completed an anonymous online survey that assessed variables associated with SI including demographics, current psychiatric diagnoses, and pre-, during, and post-deployment experiences. Those deployed had significantly higher rates of SI (5.5%) than those not deployed (3.0%; p<.001). In multivariate analyses, among those not deployed, SI was significantly associated with major depressive disorder (p<.001), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (p<.001), prior psychological trauma (p<.01), and heavy/hazardous alcohol consumption (p<.05). In contrast, in the deployed, only PTSD (p<.001) and deployment-related mild traumatic brain injury (p<.05) were independently associated with SI. Risk and protective factors differed by deployment status in National Guard members suggesting the possible need for cohort-specific treatment targets to minimize SI.",
