    "Article Title": "WORK-RELATED OUTCOME AFTER ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME: IMPLICATIONS OF COMPLEX CARDIAC REHABILITATION IN OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: Coronary heart disease is frequent in the working-age population. Traditional outcomes, such as mortality and hospital readmission, are useful for evaluating prognosis. Fit-for-work is an emerging outcome with clinical as well as socioeconomic significance. We describe the possible benefit of a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program for return to work (RTW) after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Material and Methods: We evaluated 204 patients with recent ACS. They were divided into 4 groups on the basis of their occupational work load: very light (VL), light (L), moderate (M), and heavy (H). Work-related outcomes were assessed with the Work Performance Scale (WPS) of the Functional Status Questionnaire and as days missed from work (DMW) in the previous 4 weeks. The variables considered for outcomes were percent ejection fraction, functional capacity expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs), and participation or non-participation in the CR program (CR+ and CR-). Results: One hundred thirty (66%) patients took part in the CR program. Total WPS scores for CR+ and CR-subgroups were VL group: 18 +/- 4 vs. 14 +/- 4 (p < 0.001), L group: 18 +/- 3 vs. 14 +/- 3 (p < 0.0001), M group: 19 +/- 3 vs. 16 +/- 3 (p < 0.003), and H group: 20 +/- 4 vs. 17 +/- 3 (p < 0.006). Fewer DMW were reported by the CR+ group. Conclusions: Non-participation in CR was a consistent cause of poorer work-related outcomes. Our findings indicate that CR and occupational counseling play a very important role in worker recovery and subsequent reintegration in the workplace, in particular among clerical workers.",
