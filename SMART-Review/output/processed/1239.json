    "Abstract": "Objectives: compares impact on the level of physical activity, performed by public servants, in April and November 2020. Methods: The survey examined the amount (in minutes per week) and the energy expenditure (in metabolic equivalent of task in minutes per week [METmin/week]) of physical activity for both before and during contact restrictions in April and November 2020, respectively. Results: Especially for sports activity difference was determined by the medians before (April/ November: median [Mdn] = 180.0 min/wk) and during (April: Mdn =130 minutes, November: Mdn = 60 min/wk) restrictions (P < 0.05). Also for energy consumption (METmin/wk), the medians before and during the contact restrictions declined for both periods. Conclusions: Measures against the coronavirus have led to a reduction in activity levels among public employees, regardless of their work environment. The decrease in participation in sport activities seemed to be even more noticeable within the second restriction period.",
