    "Article Title": "The social determinants of mental health disorders among women with infertility: a systematic review",
    "Abstract": "IntroductionInfertility is associated with mental health disorders in women, even if a successful pregnancy resolves infertility. However, the link between social determinants of health (SDoH) and mental health in women with infertility is not well understood. We aimed to investigate the determinants thoroughly so that mental health screening and services can be tailored to suit women with infertility who are vulnerable to mental health disorders.MethodologyAll observational studies that included women participants of reproductive age with infertility and assessed social determinants associated with mental health disorders were searched using a combination of keywords from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and published in English. Two reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, quality assessment and risk of bias. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (number CRD42022343962).ResultsThe systematic review included 32 studies out of 3405 screened articles from January 1st 2010 to 16th October 2023. Compared to women without infertility, the prevalence of mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and stress, is high among women with infertility, with the severity being influenced by social determinants-those with higher education, employment, higher personal or family income, private health insurance, higher social support, stronger religious beliefs, and higher spiritual well-being reported better mental health outcomes.ConclusionThe study highlights the need for early detection, tailored interventions, and integrated and comprehensive support systems to address the mental health needs of women with infertility and improve their well-being.",
