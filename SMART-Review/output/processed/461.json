    "Abstract": "In recent decades, the living conditions of young breast cancer (BC) survivors have garnered increasing attention. This population-based study aimed to identify the clinical, social and economic determinants of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and to describe other living conditions of young long-term BC survivors. Women with non-metastatic BC diagnosed between 2006 and 2015, aged 45 years and younger at the time of diagnosis, were identified through the Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Registry of the Cote d'Or, France. Participants completed self-report questionnaires including standardized measures of HRQoL, anxiety, depression, social deprivation, social support and sexuality. Fertility and professional reintegration issues were also assessed. The determinants of HRQoL were identified using mixed regression model. In total, 218 BC survivors participated in the survey. The main determinants of poor HRQoL were anxiety, depression, comorbidities, social deprivation and menopausal status. Among 72% of women who did not receive information about fertility preservation, 38% of them would have liked to have been informed. Finally, 39% of survivors reported a negative impact of BC on their professional activity. This study showed that BC stage or treatments did not have an impact on HRQOL of young long-term BC survivors. Fertility, sexuality and professional reintegration remained the main concerns for survivors. Specific interventions in these population should focus on these issues.",
