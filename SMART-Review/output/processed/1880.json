    "Abstract": "Objective: This study explored the prevalence and associations of eight WHO-defined CVD risk factors for death and disability in people with psychosis.Method: The study included 1156 people aged 18-64 years, diagnosed with psychosis. The 2009 World Health Organisation (WHO) GlobalHealth Risks Report was used as a framework to determine the prevalence and number of eight key risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men and women with psychosis. Differences in the number and type of risk factors by age and gender were investigated. Multi-predictor analysis was performed to identify associations between demographic factors, psychiatric diagnosis and accumulative CVD risk factors.Results: Women had fewer CVD risk factors than men. The number of risk factors significantly decreased in association with single marital status, current employment and significantly increased with earning a higher income. People aged 35-49 years and 50-64 years had an average of 4 risk factors (SD 1.38 and 1.30); people aged 1834 years had an average of 3 risk factors (SD 1.30). Mean risk factors were higher in the middle age and older age groups (35-49 years and 50-64 years) compared with the younger age group (18-34 years) (p < 0.0001). Overweight/obesity, hypertension, high blood glucose/diabetes and high cholesterol were significantly more prevalent in older men and women.Conclusion: People with psychosis have a high prevalence of individual and aggregate CVD risks. These were more common in men and rose with age, implying the necessity of close clinical monitoring. The most common risk factors should be targeted by lifestyle interventions.
