    "Article Title": "Keeping our staff in mind: Dietary results of a lifestyle intervention targeting mental health staff",
    "Abstract": "Issues addressed 1) Describe the dietary intake of mental health staff within South Eastern Sydney Local Health District and 2) Evaluate the impact of an individualised staff lifestyle program on the following nutrition parameters; (i) energy, (ii) core food groups and (iii) discretionary foods. Methods This was a pragmatic single-arm intervention study, conducted for all staff working in a public mental health service, in Sydney, Australia. A five-session individualised lifestyle intervention delivered over 5 weeks incorporated nutritional counselling delivered by a dietitian. Participants were assessed at baseline, following the intervention, and at follow-up using diet history to assess dietary intake. Results Eighty-eight staff completed the dietary intervention and follow-up. An intake of core food groups significantly below national recommendations was reported for total vegetables (-1.75 +/- 0.14 serves,P < .001), fruit (-0.29 +/- 0.11 serves,P = .01), grains (-1.25 +/- 0.20 serves,P < .001) and dairy servings (-1.00 +/- 1.08 serves,P < .001), and protein-based foods were significantly above national recommendations (0.2 +/- 0.09 serves,P = .03). At completion of the program, energy from discretionary foods was reduced by 460 kJ (95% CI -635 to -285,P < .001), and the serves of total vegetables (0.91 serves, 95% CI 0.59-1.22,P < .001) and dairy (0.31 serves, 95% CI 0.11-0.50,P < .001) were increased significantly. Conclusions A workplace-based well-being program for staff working in the mental health setting coincided with dietary improvements. So what Mental health staff can act as positive role models for clients to promote developing positive physical health behaviours.",
