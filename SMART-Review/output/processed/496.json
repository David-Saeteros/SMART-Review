    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Working adolescents are at a greater risk of mental disorders than are non-working adolescents. The present study was aimed at determining the magnitude and determinants of emotional and behavioral problems in working adolescents.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 343 adolescents attending two vocational training centers in the province of Balikesir between January 2016 and March 2016. The data were collected with the Personal Information Form, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In the analysis, descriptive statistics, the t-test, Mann Whitney U test and one way ANOVA were used.RESULTS: In the study of the adolescents, 16.9% were determined to have abnormal emotional and behavioral problems. Of the participating adolescents, girls, those with physical illnesses, living in fragmented families, perceiving their economic status as good, having fathers with primary school education and/or having mothers with high school or higher education had significantly higher emotional and behavioral problem scores (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: In this study, approximately one-fifth working Turkish adolescents had abnormal mental status. Based on the aforementioned results, it can be suggested to develop intervention programs for the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of emotional and behavioral problems in working adolescents.",
