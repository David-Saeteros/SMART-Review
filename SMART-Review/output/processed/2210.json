    "Abstract": "Persons with substance use disorders (SUDs) experience high unemployment rates that can increase relapse risk. Research on employment counseling for this population is lacking. This study examined a direct skills teaching (DST) approach to improve job interview preparedness. Graduate internship students at mental health and rehabilitation agency sites in the Northeast provided Presenting Qualifications, a brief, DST-based, group curriculum to 55 participants with SUDs in 15 different groups. At post-intervention, participants reported increased confidence and knowledge with aspects of presenting oneself during a job interview. This approach can potentially help this population achieve better employment outcomes through a group intervention.",
