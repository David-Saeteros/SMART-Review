    "Article Title": "Realist synthesis of a rapid response system in managing mental state deterioration in acute hospital settings",
    "Abstract": "Mental state deterioration in patients poses significant challenges in healthcare, potentially resulting in adverse outcomes for patients and continued reliance on restrictive interventions. Implementing evidence-based approaches such as a rapid response system that prioritises early identification and intervention can effectively manage adverse outcomes. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness of these interventions. The objective of this synthesis was to test and refine initial programme theories by synthesising evidence to understand what works, for whom and under what circumstances. Based on the realist synthesis methodology, we searched EMBASE, CINAHL, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and grey literature for evidence to inform contexts, mechanisms and outcomes on the functioning of a rapid response model. We identified 28 relevant sources encompassing peer-reviewed journal articles and grey literature. This synthesis identified three important elements that contribute to the effectiveness of a rapid response system for managing mental state deterioration: care processes, therapeutic practices and organisational support. Essential elements include improving confidence and clinical skills through training, timely assessment and intervention, teamwork, communication and the creation of governance structures for monitoring and evaluation. To ensure the effectiveness, an organisation must adopt a comprehensive approach that incorporates organisational support, resource allocation, training, clear communication channels and commitment to continuous quality improvement. However, implementing interventions within a complex healthcare system requires thoughtful consideration of the organisational culture and governance structures. By taking a comprehensive and holistic approach to improvement initiatives, organisations can strive to achieve optimal outcomes in managing mental state deterioration and improving patient care.",
