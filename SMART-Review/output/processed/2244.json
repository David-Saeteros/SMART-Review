    "Article Title": "Is the worsening of psychosocial exposures associated with mental health? Comparing two population-based cross-sectional studies in Spain, 2005-2010",
    "Abstract": "AimsTo analyze whether associations between workplace psychosocial exposures and the mental health of the working population in Spain changed between 2005 and 2010.MethodsTwo representative samples of the Spanish working population have been analyzed, 2005 (n=5073) and 2010 (n=3544).ResultsIn 2010 there was a significant association between poor mental health and exposure to high Demands, low Social Support and high Insecurity over working conditions, and exposure to high Insecurity over losing the job only for men. In 2005 there was a significant association with exposure to high Demands and low Social Support.ConclusionChanges in the associations between psychosocial risks and mental health may be related to the socioeconomic context marked by the rise in unemployment and the destruction of jobs as a result of the 2008 economic crisis.
