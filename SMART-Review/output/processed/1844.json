    "Article Title": "Opening Doors to Employment: A Needs Assessment to Investigate Benefits and Work Counseling for People with Serious Mental Illness",
    "Abstract": "A needs assessment offers empirical evidence that organizational leaders can use to make defensible decisions to achieve desired results. Thus, this case study describes a needs assessment in which we sought to improve the performance of organizations delivering benefits advisement for people with serious mental illness (SMI) within their vocational rehabilitation program. To achieve a high level of confidence in the conclusions drawn from the data gathered, we triangulated different sources and data collection methods. To ensure a systemic representation, we gathered data from informants at all levels of the synchronized analysis model (SAM) (Marker, A., 2007, Synchronized analysis model: Linking Gilbert's behavior engineering model with environmental analysis models, Performance improvement, 46(1), 26-32), including vocational rehabilitation professionals and their supervisors, directors of managed care organizations, and State Agency A (pseudonym). Data collection methods included extant data review, semi-structured interviews, and a scenario-based assessment. A client sponsor used the results to prioritize and select performance improvement interventions. In this article, we share the case study process and findings.",
