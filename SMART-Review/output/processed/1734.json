    "Article Title": "Unmet Needs Among Out of Care and Recently Diagnosed Women of Color With HIV: Opportunities for Focused Interventions",
    "Abstract": "Objective: Women of color (WoC) have lower retention in care and higher HIV/AIDS-related morbidity, compared with other populations. Barriers to care include lack of family support, inadequate HIV/AIDS services, and stigma, and women may face greater unmet needs for services including housing and employment. This descriptive study explores the unmet needs of WoC participating in the Health Resources and Services Administration's Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program, Dissemination of Evidence Informed Interventions (HRSA/SPNS DEII) Initiative. Setting: Six urban health clinics across the United States. Participants: Eligible participants were cis- or transgender women who were newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in the past 12 months, out of care for at least 6 months, or not virally suppressed. Participants enrolled from November 2016 to November 2018. Main Outcomes: Our primary outcome of interest was unmet needs at enrollment for 6 core services: housing, transportation, benefits, mental health or substance use treatment, medication assistance, and medical care. We examined differences in unmet needs stratified by participant characteristics and used multivariate regression to identify the social and health risk factors associated with higher unmet needs. Results: Among the 529 WoC, the most frequently reported expressed needs were transportation (50.1%), housing (41.2%), benefits (28.2%), medication assistance (24.5%), and substance use or mental health treatment (24.3%). Participants with a significantly higher number of overall unmet needs included those who were older (40 years or older), were unstably housed, had a history of incarceration, identified as a transgender woman, were US born, had no caregiver responsibilities, and did not have a case manager at enrollment. Conclusions: Our findings indicate the importance of screening for and developing focused strategies to address the unmet needs for WoC if viral suppression is to be achieved.",
