    "Abstract": "Individuals who have experienced mental disorders face significant career barriers that are not related to their capabilities nor their desire to participate in the workforce. Their unique skills and strengths often go unrecognized. This creates a situation where a population with immense potential and valuable perspective is often overlooked or deemed unemployable. By neglecting to tap into their talents, employers not only perpetuate a cycle of stigma and discrimination but also miss out on the opportunity to benefit from their diverse contributions. Through recognizing and drawing out strengths, career counsellors can play a vital role in transforming the narrative surrounding these individuals and can help foster a more inclusive and equitable employment environment. It is essential to address the dual challenge of reducing employment barriers while highlighting the invaluable qualities and qualifications that make this population uniquely qualified for various careers. This article discusses key career barriers faced by individuals who have experienced a mental disorder and their unique career strengths. This article also presents relevant career counselling considerations aimed at assisting clients in navigating these unique challenges while capitalizing on their unique strengths.",
