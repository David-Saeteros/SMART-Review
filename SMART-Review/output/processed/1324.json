    "Article Title": "The social determinants of substance use for aboriginal women: A systematic review",
    "Abstract": "Although women who use substances are often also facing severe economic and social problems, little is known about the relationship between social determinants of health and substance use among women. Furthermore, despite their increased visibility in substance use programs and policies in Canada, little is known about the social contexts of substance use among Aboriginal women. I systematically reviewed empirical research published from 1997 through March 2013 that examined the relationship between social determinants of health and substance use among Aboriginal women. Studies that were peer-reviewed, published in English, and had an abstract were included. Of an initial 261 studies, only sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria (fourteen quantitative, one qualitative, one mixed methods). The social determinants of health that were explored in these studies were socio-demographics factors, trauma, gender, social environments, colonialism, culture, and employment. The studies identified significant relationships between the social determinants of health and substance use among Aboriginal women. The almost exclusive use of quantitative methods and the prioritization of certain social determinants of health over others prevented a comprehensive and contextual understanding of substance use among Aboriginal women. Further research is needed to understand these significant relationships, particularly in relation to Aboriginal-specific determinants of health.",
