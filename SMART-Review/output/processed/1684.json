    "Article Title": "Return to Work, Fatigue and Cancer Rehabilitation after Curative Radiotherapy and Radiochemotherapy for Pelvic Gynecologic Cancer",
    "Abstract": "Simple Summary Rehabilitation from cancer treatment and therapy-induced toxicity requires individualized and specialized expertise. Beyond the resolution of treatment-related morbidity, socio-economic and psychological factors must be considered, and lifestyle or household characteristics can have a notable impact on the gradual return to normality and return-to-work rates following cancer therapy. A better identification of patients at a higher risk of prolonged impairment, and a more in-depth understanding of the impacts of treatment is needed to optimize post-therapy recovery. We aim to add to a limited body of literature exploring the posttreatment rehabilitative factors for women following curative radiotherapy for primary gynecologic malignancies. Herein we observed therapy-induced pain and fatigue were significantly more likely to interfere with return-to-work rates. Social support services and post-treatment inpatient cancer rehabilitation programs were helpful in keeping patients connected to their professional lives. Mental issues and the development of depression during follow-up remains an issue particularly for younger patients. Pain, fatigue, and depression are a common cluster of symptoms among cancer patients that impair quality of life and daily activities. We aimed to evaluate the burden of cancer rehabilitation and return-to-work (RTW) rates. Tumor characteristics, lifestyle and household details, treatment data, the use of in-house social services and post-treatment inpatient rehabilitation, and RTW were assessed for 424 women, diagnosed with cervical, uterine, or vaginal/vulvar cancer, receiving curative radio(chemo)therapy. Progression-free RTW rate at 3 months was 32.3%, and increased to 58.1% and 63.2% at 12 and 18 months, respectively. Patients with advanced FIGO stages and intensified treatments significantly suffered more from acute pain and fatigue. A higher Charlson-Comorbidity-Index reliably predicted patients associated with a higher risk of acute fatigue during RT. Aside from the presence of children, no other household or lifestyle factor was correlated with increased fatigue rates. Women aged <= 45 years had a significantly higher risk of developing depression requiring treatment during follow-up. Post-treatment inpatient cancer rehabilitation, including exercise and nutrition counseling, significantly relieved fatigue symptoms. The burdens for recovery from cancer therapy remain multi-factorial. Special focus needs to be placed on identifying high-risk groups experiencing fatigue or pain. Specialized post-treatment inpatient cancer rehabilitation can improve RTW rates.",
