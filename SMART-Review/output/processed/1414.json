    "Article Title": "Brief report: Changes in quality of life and social functioning during vocational program - a pilot study of autistic adults",
    "Abstract": "Background Quality of life (QoL), social-emotional and occupational functioning are often diminished in young autistic adults. Measuring these constructs as vocational training outcomes may inform future programming and relevancy of measures. Methods This pilot study analyzed changes in social-emotional functioning and QoL during the involvement at a vocational program for autistic adults using the WHOQOL-BREF, a modified version of the Birchwood- Social Functioning Scale (SFS-m) and a piloted measure. Participants completed these self-reported questionnaires upon admission and at 3 months. Results Significant change was found on the SFS-m and two WHOQOL-BREF domains: psychological and environmental. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that autistic adults, similar in characterization, can self-report using these QoL and social measures; further, these measures are sensitive to certain changes over time in such group programs.",
