    "Article Title": "Factors associated with internalized HIV-related stigma among biological mothers living with HIV enrolled in a US cohort study",
    "Abstract": "Understanding factors associated with internalized HIV-related stigma among mothers living with HIV may improve health outcomes. We examined factors (age, race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, marital status, health limitations, and years since HIV diagnosis) associated with internalized HIV-related stigma among biological mothers of children enrolled in the Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities study of the US-based Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study. Stigma was measured with the Internalized HIV Stigma Scale (IHSS), completed biennially at their child's 11-17-year visits. Linear regression models were fit with generalized estimating equations to evaluate the association between the factors of interest and internalized HIV-related stigma using all completed IHSS surveys. Among 438 eligible mothers, the mean IHSS score was 43.7 (SD = 19.5). Higher IHSS scores were observed for widowed women compared to married women, with an estimated mean difference of 8.91 (95% CI: 2.25, 15.57) after adjusting for age, education, income, and health limitations. Years since HIV diagnosis was associated with internalized HIV-related stigma. For every year of increase since HIV diagnosis, IHSS scores decreased by 0.54 per year, after adjusting for age (95% CI: -0.92, -0.17). Interventions to reduce internalized HIV-related stigma should target mothers who are widowed and those with a more recent HIV diagnosis.",
