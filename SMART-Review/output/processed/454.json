    "Abstract": "The majority of workers experiencing anxiety or depressive symptoms remain employed, but few studies have investigated how they manage their symptoms while working. This study aims to identify the self-management strategies used by these workers to promote their functioning at work. Semistructured interviews were conducted with workers presenting symptoms of anxiety or depression (n = 25). A total of 54 self-management strategies that emerged from thematic analysis were grouped into three main categories: behavioural (managing tasks, worktime, workspace, and relationships; managing boundaries between work and personal life; using time off work to recover energy; taking care of one's physical health and seeking social support), cognitive (practicing self-compassion; managing negative thoughts; adopting a positive outlook; accepting situations as they are; living the present moment; and developing self-awareness), and affective (identifying and managing emotions). The results provide a comprehensive picture of the various self-management strategies that can be included in programmes to promote mental health in the workplace and disseminated to employees experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression.Public Significance Statement Various mental health self-management strategies can be implemented by workers experiencing anxiety or depressive symptoms. These strategies can be applied by workers during both work and nonwork hours to enhance functioning at work. Organizations can encourage the use of self-management strategies as concrete avenues of action to promote mental health at work.",
