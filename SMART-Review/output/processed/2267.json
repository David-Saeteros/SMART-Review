    "Article Title": "Satisfaction With Work-Family Balance Mediates the Relationship Between Workplace Social Support and Depression Among Hospice Nurses",
    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social support (from personal and workplace sources) and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms), as well as to examine the mediating role of satisfaction with work-family balance among hospice nurses. Design and Method A cross-sectional study design was utilized with a sample of 90 hospice nurses from the southern United States. Participants completed online surveys, including (a) the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), (b) loosely adapted items from the Affectivity, Burnout, and Absenteeism Scales, and (c) Satisfaction with Work-Family Balance Scale. Findings Workplace social support, not personal social support, was associated with lower psychological distress, and satisfaction with work-family balance mediated the relationship between workplace social support and depression symptoms, a component of psychological distress. Conclusions Hospice nurses' social support in the workplace and their satisfaction with the balance between their work and family lives play a role in supporting their mental health.",
