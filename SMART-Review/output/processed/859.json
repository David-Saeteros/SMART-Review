    "Abstract": "The influence of psychosocial factors on the subjective wellbeing of asylum-seekers residing in host Western countries has scarcely been explored qualitatively. Qualitative data derived from a mixed methods prospective study investigated the subjective wellbeing of 56 community-dwelling asylum-seekers and refugees at baseline and an average of 15.7months later. Positive and negative experiences over time were explored in relation to self-perceived emotional health. Nineteen positive and 15 negative categories of experience emerged. Distinct psychosocial and protective factors were salient regarding the valence of experiences over time, with positive experiences comprising employment, improved financial circumstances, and social support or connectivity. Negative experiences included news of adversity from one's homeland, un(der)employment, poor health, and factors relating to the refugee determination process. Positive and negative experiences were contemporaneous, indicating that employment and social support may ameliorate the detrimental impact of traversing the protracted process of refugee status determination for asylum-seekers in particular.",
