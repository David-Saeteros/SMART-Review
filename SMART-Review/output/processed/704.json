    "Abstract": "The well-being and satisfaction of individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI) and their family caregivers are less than desirable. Research on the quality of life (QoL) of individuals with SMI and their caregivers, including disorders other than schizophrenia, is limited. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the self-perception of QoL in patients with SMI and their family caregivers and the associated factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with SMI and their caregivers who completed self-assessment instruments to determine their QoL. Social support and burden in caregivers and symptomatology levels in individuals with SMI were assessed. The physical aspect of QoL in individuals with SMI was associated with employment status and symptom severity. The physical component of caregivers' QoL was associated with kinship relationship, the presence of other family members with disabilities, social support, and age. The mental component was associated with global symptomatology and the diagnosis of major depression in individuals with SMI and caregiver burden in family members. In conclusion, these findings on correlated factors of QoL in individuals with SMI and their caregivers could be used in developing therapeutic interventions for mental health.",
