    "Article Title": "Asthma - workplace - psyche",
    "Abstract": "Depending on the literature source 10 - 15% of all asthma diseases in adults are related to the workplace. Work related asthma can be triggered by allergens as well as by chemicals. The diagnostic of work related asthma includes work place related medical history, allergological tests for occupational allergens and the attempt to objectify the reported association of symptoms to the workplace, for example by monitoring lung function with and without exposure at the workplace. During career counselling patients with allergic asthma should be advised against taking a job with occupational allergen exposure. Also in patients with occupational asthma relations between psychological comorbidities like depression or anxiety can be stated. Quality of life in patients with occupational asthma is low compared to patients with fateful asthma, possibly due to extensive social and financial consequences. Psycho- logical factors can also fake an occupational asthma, as it is known in vocal cord dysfunction, sick building syndrome or anxiety due to emissions of laser printers in offices.",
