    "Abstract": "ObjectivesThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health indicators, leading to an increase in symptoms of anxiety and depression in both the general population of adults and children and many occupational groups. This study aims to examine changes in anxiety and depression among a cohort of public health workers in the U.S. during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential risk factors.MethodsLongitudinal data were collected from a sub-sample (N = 85) of public health workers in 23 U.S. states who completed two surveys in 2020 and 2021. Information on background characteristics, personal well-being, and work environment as well as validated scales to assess generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive disorder, and burnout was collected. Data were analyzed using Stata Version 17, and significant differences were determined using Pearson's Chi(2) and Fisher's Exact tests.ResultsThe proportion of those reporting GAD (46.3% to 23.2%) or depression (37.8% to 26.8%) improved from Survey 1 to Survey 2 overall; symptoms of anxiety saw the largest improvement. Persistent depression was associated with sustained burnout, changes in social support, and days worked per week.ConclusionPublic health workers experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression during the initial pandemic response, but a reduction in these symptoms was observed in the subsequent year after vaccines had become widely available. However, unmet needs remain for ongoing workplace mental health supports to address burnout, as well as for additional emotional supports outside of work for public health professionals.",
