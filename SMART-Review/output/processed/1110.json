    "Article Title": "Psychosis spectrum illnesses as disorders of prefrontal critical period plasticity",
    "Abstract": "Emerging research on neuroplasticity processes in psychosis spectrum illnesses-from the synaptic to the macrocircuit levels-fill key gaps in our models of pathophysiology and open up important treatment considerations. In this selective narrative review, we focus on three themes, emphasizing alterations in spike-timing dependent and Hebbian plasticity that occur during adolescence, the critical period for prefrontal system development: (1) Experience-dependent dysplasticity in psychosis emerges from activity decorrelation within neuronal ensembles. (2) Plasticity processes operate bidirectionally: deleterious environmental and experiential inputs shape microcircuits. (3) Dysregulated plasticity processes interact across levels of scale and time and include compensatory mechanisms that have pathogenic importance. We present evidence that-given the centrality of progressive dysplastic changes, especially in prefrontal cortex-pharmacologic or neuromodulatory interventions will need to be supplemented by corrective learning experiences for the brain if we are to help people living with these illnesses to fully thrive.",
