    "Abstract": "Objective: To measure community mental health agency staff attitudes about employment for persons with serious mental illness. Methods: An online survey was developed and sent to 2,218 staff at 4 community mental health centers (CMHC) in 1 New England state. The survey collected quantitative and qualitative data about staff attitudes about employment for persons with serious mental illness. Descriptive statistics and qualitative results are provided. Results from analysis of variance are provided as well, assessing differences in staff views by staff characteristics. Results: A mix of clinical and administrative staff participated in the survey (N = 221). Staff views on the benefits of work, the ability of clients to handle the demands of the worker role, and client motivation to work were mixed. Staff with higher levels of education held significantly more supportive views than those with less education. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: CMHC staff need to consistently convey supportive attitudes about employment to their clients.",
