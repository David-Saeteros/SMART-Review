    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on return to work have been the focus of many clinical studies in recent years. Veterans with a history of TBI may be at increased risk of unemployment.OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand predictors of work outcomes for Veterans with a history of TBI who received evidence-based supported employment.METHODS: Fifty unemployed Veterans with a history of mild-to-moderate TBI and current neuropsychological impairment participated in a 12-month supported employment intervention. Demographic data and baseline assessments of neuropsychological impairment, functional capacity, and psychiatric and post-concussive symptom severity were investigated as predictors of work outcomes (job attainment, weeks worked, and wages earned).RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that lower disability ratings, more recent work history, more months worked in the past 5 years, lower PTSD symptom severity, worse verbal memory, and better cognitive flexibility were all associated with better work outcomes. In multivariate regression analyses, better cognitive flexibility and worse verbal memory performance predicted better work outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to determine how treatment of cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms is related to return to work in Veterans with a history of TBI.",

The study is conducted in the US, within the specified timeframe of 2005-2025. The intervention is supported employment, which is one of the included interventions. The population is people with a history of traumatic brain injury, meeting the population criteria. The outcomes include employment or labor outcomes such as job duration and job quality, meeting the outcome criteria.",
