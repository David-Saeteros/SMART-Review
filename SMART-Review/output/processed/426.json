    "Article Title": "Making the Case for IPS Supported Employment",
    "Abstract": "Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based practice for helping people with severe mental illness (SMI) gain competitive employment, yet those who could benefit often find it difficult to obtain IPS services. We summarize the evidence supporting the effectiveness of IPS and the benefits of working, discuss the barriers to implementing IPS in the U.S., and suggest policy changes that could expand its access.",
