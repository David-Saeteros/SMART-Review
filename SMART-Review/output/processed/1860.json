    "Article Title": "Improving career wellbeing of individuals with serious mental illness",
    "Abstract": "Employment has been shown to be a strong predictor of recovery in individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) and is often amongst the foremost reported goals of this population. Yet individuals with SMI continue to face high levels of unemployment and employment marginalisation. This article aims to outline three major career barriers unique to this population: interrupted vocational development, symptoms of the illness itself, and stigma and discrimination. Three theoretical lenses, Social Cognitive Career Theory, Cochran's Narrative Career Theory, and Chaos Theory of Careers, will be utilised to frame these issues and to identify relevant and effective career interventions for individuals with SMI.",
