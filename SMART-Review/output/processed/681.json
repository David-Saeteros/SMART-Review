    "Abstract": "Young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience significant rates of unemployment and underemployment, and the field needs an inexpensive, evidence-based vocational intervention. We examined an approach developed for people with serious mental illness, IPS supported employment, for young adults with ASD. We described a pilot IPS program for young adults with ASD and evaluated the first five participants over 1 year. The first five IPS participants succeeded in competitive employment, expanded independence, and achieved broad psychosocial gains. IPS could help young adults with ASD succeed in competitive employment at a relatively low cost.",
