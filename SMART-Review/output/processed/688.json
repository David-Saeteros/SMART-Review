    "Abstract": "Anxiety and depression are among the most common mental disorders in the workplace and represent one of the leading causes of disability among workers. Symptoms related to these disorders have important repercussions for workers and organizations, such as a decrease in job satisfaction, as well as various difficulties in functioning at work (e.g., presenteeism, absenteeism). Social support from colleagues and relatives represents a promising lever to support the numerous workers living with symptoms of depression or anxiety.Objective The aim of this study was to identify the social support practices of relatives and colleagues that are perceived as being beneficial to the work functioning of individuals with anxiety or depressive symptoms.Method To do this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with workers presenting symptoms of anxiety or depression (n=25) in order to explore their experiences regarding the social support they received. A 6-step thematic analysis was then performed.Results The results of our research identified 30 social support practices and grouped them into 5 broad functions: friendship (e.g., laughing with colleagues, contacting loved ones through technology or social networks during working hours), emotional support (e.g., listening, resolving conflicts quickly), social support (e.g., sharing experiences with others), instrumental support (e.g., helping with work-related or non-work-related tasks), informational support (e.g., giving advice to help reduce anxiety or depressive symptoms), and validation (e.g., normalizing or de- dramatizing situations).Conclusion In short, this study provides a relevant portrait of the various social support practices that relatives and colleagues can put forward to promote the functioning of workers presenting symptoms of anxiety or depression.",
