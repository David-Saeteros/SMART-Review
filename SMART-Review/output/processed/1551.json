    "Article Title": "INCREASING EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND USE OF HEALTH SERVICES AMONG HOSPITALITY I NDUSTRY WORKERS DURING AND AFTER THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN",
    "Abstract": "Objective: To examine the emotional distress situation among hospitality industry workers and their access to and use of health care including telehealth services during the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: A survey was administered on the Qualtrics platform both in English and Spanish from November 18, 2020, to November 30, 2020, through the Culinary Workers Union in Nevada. A total of 1182 union members participated in the survey, of whom 892 completed the survey. Descriptive and multivariable regression analyses were conducted. Results: Among 892 respondents, 78% were people of color; 71% were laid off or furloughed during the COVID-related shutdown, but most had access to health care. Further, 78.8% experienced at least 2 or more signs of emotional distress during the pandemic. Females and unemployment status were positively associated with experiencing emotional distress. About 43.5% received care through telehealth, although most did not prefer telehealth (74.2%). Only 18.3% of non-telehealth users were interested in telehealth and 15.0% had never heard about telehealth. Conclusions: Health insurance coverage is essential for access to health services regardless of employment status. Strengthening mental health services, including psychological counselling for hospitality workers, is needed in such public health emergency situations as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
