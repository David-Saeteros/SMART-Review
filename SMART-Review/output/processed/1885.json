    "Article Title": "Opinions and Expectations Related to Job Placement of Individuals with Schizophrenia: A Qualitative Study Including Both Patients and Employers",
    "Abstract": "The present study was conducted to identify the problems related to the placement of individuals with schizophrenia into jobs, the conditions allowing them to keep working and to reveal obstacles to their employment. The depth-interview technique was used for obtaining information from both patients with schizophrenia (n=25) and the human resource managers of selected companies (n=8). All interviews were recorded, transcribed and assessed using a thematic analysis approach. After the evaluation of qualitative data, the main emerging themes included the problems and suggestions of the patients, the worries of the employers about persons with schizophrenia and things that they could do about employment. The results of this study can be used to identify solutions to the problem as they were obtained from the individuals who were personally experiencing employment difficulties and from the employers, who were in a position to help solve the problems.",
