    "Article Title": "Permanent unfitness for work and mental disorders: a multicentric cross-sectional study of 2,788 unfit employees",
    "Abstract": "In France, Mental Disorders (MD) are the second most common medical cause of unfitness-for-work notices. The main objective is to describe the MD causing permanent medically unfitness at the workstation. A cross-sectional multicenter survey was conducted among employees followed by 323 physicians from occupational health services of the South of France in 2017. The MD responsible for unfitness for the job were coded according to the ICD-10 nomenclature and their occupational origin was estimated by each physician. On 359,966 employees screened, 2,788 were unfitted. Among the 2,779 unfitness cases which were analysed, 985 were unfitted for MD. The incidence rate of unfitness for MD was 2.78 unfit per 1,000 employees followed. Representing 36.8% (985 cases) of all grounds for unfitness, MD were estimated to be work-related in 614 (63.6%) of cases. The main MD were 449 (45.6%) cases of major depressive episodes, 227 (23.0%) anxiety disorders and 131 (13.3%) recurrent depressive disorders. Their occupational origin was mentioned in 296 (67.3%), 168 (74.7%), 62 (49.6%) cases and the link with a Burnout (BO) in 166 (38.3%), 61 (27.9%) and 41 (34.2%) cases respectively among 364 all pathologies reported to a BO. Unfitness for MD was more common among women (ORa = 1.79 95% CI [1.50-2.13]), working in trade, transport, accommodation and catering (ORa = 1.47 95% CI [1.04-2.09]) and increase with age (ORa = 4.24 95% CI [2.73-6.60] for over 55). Major depressive episodes represent the MD most frequently responsible for unfitness and the most related to occupational origin.",
