    "Abstract": "Purpose Identify ethical issues that arise in the coordination of return-to-work (RTW) among employees on sick leave due to common mental disorders (CMDs). Material and methods 41 semi-structured individual interviews and one focus group interview with stakeholders (n = 46) involved in RTW: employees on sick leave due to CMDs, coordinators and physicians at primary health care centres, managers, representatives of the Swedish social insurance agency and occupational health services. A six-step thematic analysis focused on the ethical values and norms related to autonomy, privacy, resources and organization, and professional values. Results Five themes were identified: (1) autonomous decision-making versus the risk of taking over, (2) employee rights versus restrictions to self-determination, (3) respect for employee privacy versus stakeholders' interests, (4) risk of unequal inclusion due to insufficient organizational structure and resources, (5) risk of unequal support due to unclear professional roles and responsibilities. Conclusion The main ethical issues are the risks of unequal access to and unequal support for the coordination of RTW. For the fair and equal provision of coordination, it is necessary to be transparent on how to prioritize the coordination of RTW for different patient groups, provide clarity about the coordinator's professional role, and facilitate ongoing boundary work between stakeholders.",
