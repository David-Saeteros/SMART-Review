    "Abstract": "Background Many people who experience a disaster will do so as part of an occupational group, either by chance or due to the nature of their role.Sources of data This review is based on literature published in scientific journals.Areas of agreement There are many social and occupational factors, which affect post-disaster mental health. In particular, effective social supportboth during and post-disasterappears to enhance psychological resilience.Areas of controversy There is conflicting evidence regarding the best way to support trauma-exposed employees. Many organisations carry out post-incident debriefing despite evidence that this is unhelpful.Growing points Employees who are well supported tend to have better psychological outcomes and as a result may be more likely to perform well at work.Areas timely for developing research The development and evaluation of workplace interventions designed to help managers facilitate psychological resilience in their workforce is a priority. Successful interventions could substantially increase resilience and reduce the risk of long-term mental health problems in trauma-exposed employees.",
