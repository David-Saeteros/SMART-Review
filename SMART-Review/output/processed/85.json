    "Abstract": "ObjectiveTest an intervention for individuals with schizophrenia at an Adult Inpatient Unit with employment and social inclusion goals, compared to treatment as usual.MethodA single-blind, randomised, controlled trial assigned 25 participants to treatment as usual and 26 participants to receive an Individual Placement and Support (IPS) Disability Employment Service (DES) information pack and an offer of support from a nurse. Outcomes were measured at 6 and 12 months using Job Acquisition, IPS DES employment provider, Activity Participation Questionnaire-Revised, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Adult Hope Scale questionnaires, and Digit Span and Trail Making tests.ResultsThe intervention did not result in significant contact with the DES employment provider or paid employment outcomes. Secondary outcomes from combining groups due to high attrition rates: A significant proportion of participants obtained unpaid work from baseline to 6 months follow-up (N = 24, p = 0.001).ConclusionsThe 'light touch' intervention did not promote change. More support is required during inpatient admissions and after discharge to assist people with schizophrenia achieve their vocational goals.",
