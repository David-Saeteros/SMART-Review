    "Article Title": "Hazardous alcohol consumption across different industries in Sweden: a pooled cross-sectional study",
    "Abstract": "Aim: The current study aims to (i) examine differences in hazardous alcohol consumption across different industries in Sweden and (ii) assess to what degree any such difference can be attributed to a differential distribution of nicotine use, health, and work environments among individuals working in these industries. Methods: A pooled cross-sectional study was conducted including all participants of the survey of Health, Work Environment, and Lifestyle Habits between 2012 and 2023 (n = 54 378), collected by an occupational health service company (Feelgood). The survey contained self-reported information on alcohol use, industry, nicotine use, health, and work environment. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were obtained by pooled logistic regression analyses. Results: Hazardous alcohol use was highly prevalent in the current study population (37%), especially among individuals in the accommodation/food service, arts/entertainment/recreation, and the construction industry. Compared to individuals working in education, individuals in these industries had >1.6-fold increased odds of reporting hazardous alcohol consumption. Differences in nicotine use and physical work environment between the industries explained some of the differences in hazardous alcohol consumption between industries, while differences in health and psychosocial work environment had limited effects on the estimates. Conclusion: We identified several industries in the Swedish workforce where hazardous alcohol use is highly prevalent. While differences in nicotine use, health, and work environment explained a part of these risk differences, most of the risk differences remained.",
