    "Article Title": "Frequent attenders in occupational health primary care: A cross-sectional study",
    "Abstract": "Aims: This study characterizes frequent attenders in primary care provided by occupational health services (OHS) in Finland. Methods: This is a nationwide cross-sectional study using medical record data from an OHS provider in 2015. Frequent attenders were defined as persons who were within the top decile of annual visits to healthcare professionals (frequent attender 10%, FA10) at any of the OHS's 37 stations. FA10s within this study consulted the OHS primary care unit eight or more times during 2015. We used logistic regression to analyse factors associated with frequent attendance in OHS primary care. The independent variables were age, gender, employer size and industry, health professionals visited and diagnoses given during visits to the OHS. The dependent variable was belonging to the FA10 group. Results: Altogether 31,960 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The FA10 group included 3617 patients, who conducted 36% of visits to healthcare professionals. The findings indicate that working within the manufacturing industry, health and social services, or public administration, and being employed in medium or large companies, are associated with frequent attendance. Frequent attendance was also associated with being female, diagnoses of the musculoskeletal system, or mental and behavioral disorders. In particular, depressive episodes and anxiety were associated with FA10s. Conclusions:This research characterized FA10 clients at a Finnish OHS. Illnesses of the musculoskeletal system and mental and behavioral disorders were accentuated among FA10s. The stability of the FA10 group, along with their sickness absences and work disabilities, should be investigated further.",
