    "Abstract": "The Center for Evidence-Based Practices (CEBP), a multidisciplinary center located at the Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences (MSASS), has been in operation for the past 17 years. It is a joint project of MSASS and the Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, and funded primarily through the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, as well as a variety of contractual agreements with agencies throughout the state and the country. The CEBP provides technical assistance for service innovations that improve quality of life and other outcomes for people with mental illness or co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders. Clinical and programmatic consultation, as well as training, are provided to both public and private agencies to help them build capacity to implement and sustain research-supported interventions practices. CEBP staff also provide instruction to students in the classroom and field experiences.",
