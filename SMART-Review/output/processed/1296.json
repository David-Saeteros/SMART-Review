    "Abstract": "Objective: The present research systematically investigates the role of recognition experiences at work as a protective factor for burnout. Method: In two cross-sectional studies (N = 328 and N = 220) with employees we measured via online questionnaires three forms of recognition (achievement-based social esteem, equality-based respect, and need-based care) from coworkers and supervisors as predictors and burnout among employees as outcome. Results: Using multiple regression analyses, Study 1 provided initial evidence that both supervisor and coworker recognition were negatively associated with employees' burnout. Study 2 further demonstrated that whereas respect experiences were especially crucial for lowering emotional exhaustion, care was primarily linked to reduced depersonalization and esteem to heightened personal accomplishment. Conclusion: We discuss how positive recognition experiences can be fostered in organizations in order to buffer the negative effects burnout can cause.",
