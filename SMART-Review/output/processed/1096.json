    "Abstract": "Introduction/Objective Previous studies suggest that the number of suicides and suicide attempts will increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frequency and characteristics of suicide attempts in the Republic of Serbia.Methods The study observed two periods: the period from March to August 2020 (the COVID period) and the same period of the previous year (the non-COVID period). The observation during the mentioned periods encompassed patients who were examined at the Dr. Laza Lazarevic Clinic for Mental Disorders in Belgrade due to suicide attempts (1987 persons during COVID period and 2300 persons during the non-COVID period).Results Concerning suicide attempts, a statistically significant difference between the observed periods was registered in respect to the total number of monthly clinical examinations, monthly distribution of suicide attempts, patients' gender and age, mode of suicide attempt, and the diagnostic category. Binary logistic regression determined that statistically significant factors that can influence the suicide attempt were year, months, patients' gender and age, and diagnostic category.Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic creates the increased exposure of the people to suicide risk factors, which points to the significance of consistent monitoring of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter.",
