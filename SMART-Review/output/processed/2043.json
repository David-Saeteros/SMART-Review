    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to explore whether post-release employment reduces the risk of reincarceration after controlling for known predictors of reincarceration including mental health vulnerability, substance abuse risk, gender, age, indigenous status, and prior imprisonment. The study was a secondary analysis of data from a multisite randomized control trial (N=774) conducted in Queensland, Australia across seven prisons between August 2008 and July 2010. Data were collected at a baseline interview prior to release, and at three follow-up telephone interviews at one, three and six months post-release. Vulnerability to mental illness and risk of substance abuse (adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 2.0-3.1), and limited employment post-release (adjusted hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.1) increased the risk of reincarceration over and above the known effects of younger age, male gender, and prior incarceration history. The characteristics most associated with reincarceration can be used to triage candidates for more intensive forms of community based vocational rehabilitation.",
