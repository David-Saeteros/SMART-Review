    "Article Title": "Stakeholder perspectives on IPS for employment: A scoping review",
    "Abstract": "Background. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) has demonstrated effectiveness in achieving competitive employment for people with severe mental illness. Yet limited efforts have been made to synthesize the literature pertaining to the experiences and perspectives of key stakeholders regarding IPS, which could be helpful for occupational therapists, given their role in vocational rehabilitation. Purpose. To synthesize qualitative literature to understand how stakeholders (including occupational therapists) experience and perceive IPS and consider the implications for future occupational therapy practice and research. Method. A scoping review methodology guided our review. We conducted an electronic search of qualitative and mixed-method studies on IPS. Findings. Twenty-six articles were retrieved. Most studies sought clients' perspectives (n= 15), followed by practitioners (mostly employment specialists;n= 10) and only one with employers. Implications. There is a need for research targeting practitioners and employers which will help improve the nature of the collaboration between mental health teams, vocational teams, and employers.",
