    "Abstract": "Background Health-related quality of life (HrQoL) and workability are related parameters to measure success of therapy. Both have been insufficiently explored in patients after liver transplantation (LT). Particularly little is known about patients' attitude to return to work, employment status before LT, and how frequently there is any employment at any time after LT. Methods This is a single-center retrospective cohort study including 150 adult outpatients after LT. Liver transplantations had been performed between 1993 and 2018. The study was carried out from February to July 2018. The exclusion criteria were combined transplantations, positive screening for current alcohol abuse, and anxiety or depression. To evaluate HrQoL and fitness to work, the patients were tested using the Short Form 36, the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire, and the Work Ability Index. Key results The return rate of sufficiently filled-in questionnaires was 46.8% (66 patients). The mean age of patients was 59.9 years (SD=10.8), ranging from 25 to 78 years old. HrQoL was partly comparable to the normal population. Workability sum scores with a mean value of 31.61 (SD 9.79) suggested moderate workability at present. While only 28.8% of respondents were ever employed after LT, 45.5% currently wished to work or would have wished to work. Conclusions HRQL seems to be partly similar to population data, and subjective workability seems to be moderate in patients after LT. Despite a positive attitude to return to work in almost half of respondents, a lower rate of actual return to work was found in this study.",
