    "Article Title": "Effectiveness of personal recovery facilitators in adults with schizophrenia and other psychoses: A systematic review of reviews and narrative synthesis",
    "Abstract": "This review aimed to examine the evidence base for the use of personal recovery facilitators [non-psychopharmacological approaches] for adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychoses. A sys-tematic review (umbrella review) was conducted of reviews published in English between January 2010 and February 2022, which examined the effectiveness of personal recovery facilitators to support aspects of personal recovery as defined by the CHIME framework (connectedness, hope and optimism, identity, meaning and pur -pose, and empowerment). Twenty-one systematic reviews on thirteen different types of personal recovery fa-cilitators [PRFs] were included in this umbrella review. Only one review sought to directly measure personal recovery processes according to the CHIME framework. Outcome measures mostly aligned with the processes of hope (21 reviews) and connectedness (19 reviews). Those related to empowerment (2 reviews), identity (5 re-views) and meaning and purpose (1 review) were less frequently the focus of PRFs. Yoga and music therapy showed the most promise as PRFs. Vocational treatments and integrated supported employment show good potential as personal recovery facilitators. However, together with narrative photovoice, art making and exhi-bition, they require further robust research to fully examine their impact. Personal recovery is only beginning to be considered as an intended outcome of interventions for persons with schizophrenia and other psychoses. This may be due in part to the continued predominance of the biomedical model approach to recovery within stat-utory services. Future evaluations of PRFs should include outcome measures that directly assess personal re-covery according to the CHIME framework or other measures developed in consultation with recipients of these approaches.
