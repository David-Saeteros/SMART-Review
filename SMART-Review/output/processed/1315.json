    "Abstract": "Job demands-resources (JD-R) model of professional burnout states that job demands predict the feeling of exhaustion, and lack of job resources-disengagement from work. This research project investigated professional burnout and it correlates, including sex, death anxiety, and relationship status in 108 Polish donor transplant coordinators involved in organ, tissue, and cell transplantations. This study employed the Polish version of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory which follows the JD-R model, the Psychosocial Working Conditions Questionnaire-a Polish instrument based on the model of job stress proposed by Karasek-and the Polish version of the Fear of Death and Dying Questionnaire. The results were suggestive of average levels of job stress and burnout in the studied population, with men being more disengaged than women. Participants who were in relationship had significantly higher levels of exhaustion than those who were single. Exhaustion was positively correlated with years of working as a transplant coordinator but not with participants' age. Multiple negative correlations were detected between exhaustion/disengagement and different aspects of job control, social support, and well-being. Moreover, positive correlations between different components of fear of death and dying and exhaustion were detected. Our findings, linking fear of death and dying with some aspects of professional burnout in transplant coordinators, suggest that a pre-employment screening for the level of death anxiety in candidates for transplant coordinators could be useful as this job provides chronic exposure to mortality cues.",
