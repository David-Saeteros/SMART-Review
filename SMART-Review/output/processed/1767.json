    "Abstract": "Laboratory animal professionals (LAP) may experience situations that contribute to compassion fatigue (CF). The goal of this research was to better understand CF in LAP in and across employment categories. Surveys were distributed through LAP organizational listservs in the European Union (EU), China, and Japan, and results were analyzed to identify CF prevalence, personal and work-related factors, coping mechanisms, and beneficial work-support programs. Independent chi 2-tests compared personal and work-related factors and feelings of CF. Feelings of CF and coping mechanisms were compared with personality scores using independent sample t tests. There were 302 respondents from the EU, 39 from China, and 77 from Japan. Over half of respondents from the EU (52%) and China (56%) reported experiencing CF (52%), with fewer (32%) reporting CF in Japan. No major differences were found based on employer type. Personality scores were significantly related to feelings of CF and preferred coping mechanisms. Work-related factors that contributed to feelings of CF in over half of respondents included staffing levels, workplace relationships, and availability of programs geared to address CF. Across regions, talk -ing to someone, physical activity, getting away from work, and self-care were effective coping mechanisms in over 50% of respondents. Fewer than 30% of respondents indicated that their place of employment had CF support programs, and even fewer (8% to 28%) indicated that these programs were helpful. The study results suggest that to be effective, employer CF programs for LAP should consider providing quiet places at work and programs for self-care, promoting physical and mental health and social support systems, and establishing opportunities to memorialize animals.",
