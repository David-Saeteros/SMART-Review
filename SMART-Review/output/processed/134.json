    "Article Title": "Material Needs, Epistemic Neglect, and Slow Violence: A Systematic Review of Research Focused on Women Affected by the Criminal Legal System",
    "Abstract": "Women affected by the criminal legal system disproportionately experience economic hardship and have, over time, reported difficulties in securing basic needs, including income and employment, food and other tangible items, and housing. Women often describe assistance in acquiring these necessities as high priorities. Based on consistency of women's testimonies, we explored whether and how research aligns with women's priorities. We examined existing research by conducting a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. Despite extensive documentation of women's unmet needs, we found limited research focused on addressing and improving women's economic status, identifying mechanisms that ensure women have their basic needs met, and promoting housing stability for women. We contend that the dynamics in current research align with aspects of epistemic neglect and create a form of research-based slow violence. We discuss new research actions to change these dynamics.",
