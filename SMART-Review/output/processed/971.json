    "Abstract": "Topic: The potential of technology to enhance delivery and outcomes of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment. Purpose: IPS supported employment has demonstrated robust success for improving rates of competitive employment among individuals with psychiatric disabilities. Still, a majority of those with serious mental illnesses are not employed (Bond, Drake, & Becker, 2012). The need to promote awareness of IPS and expand services is urgent. In this study, we describe ways that technologies may enhance delivery of IPS supported employment across the care continuum and stakeholder groups. Directions for research are highlighted. Sources Used: published literature, clinical observations, IPS learning collaborative. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Technology has the potential to enhance direct service as well as workflow in the IPS supported employment process, which may lead to improved fidelity and client outcomes. Mobile and cloud technologies open opportunities for collaboration, self-directed care, and ongoing support to help clients obtain and maintain meaningful employment. Research is needed to evaluate efficacy of technology-based approaches for promoting client employment outcomes, to identify provider and organization barriers to using technology for IPS delivery, and to determine effective strategies for implementing technology with IPS in different settings and with diverse client audiences.",

            "reason": "The study focuses on the potential of technology to enhance IPS supported employment, which is not directly mentioned in the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria specifically require studies on job search services, adult training, wage subsidies, and supported employment interventions for people with mental health disorders. The study in question is more about the role of technology in IPS, which is a subset of supported employment but not explicitly mentioned in the inclusion criteria.",

However, based on the context, it appears to be a descriptive study or a review rather than an RCT or systematic review with a control group.
