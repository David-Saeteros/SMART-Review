    "Article Title": "Mental health workers' experiences of support and help-seeking following workplace violence: A qualitative study",
    "Abstract": "The consequences of workplace trauma among mental health staff can include physical injuries and somatic disorders, professional exhaustion and burnout, depression, anxiety, and other occupational stress injuries. For the well-being of staff and patients, there is a need to understand mental health workers' experiences following exposure to workplace trauma, any subsequent mental health problems, and the process of help-seeking. The nuances of these experiences can best be captured through qualitative exploration. In this study, we explored inpatient mental health workers' experiences of support and help-seeking following workplace violence. Four overall themes emerged from interviews with 12 participants: (i) validation as motivation for help-seeking; (ii) stigma as a barrier to help-seeking; (iii) gaps in services provided; and (iv) desire for accessible and effective trauma support and education. This study demonstrates the need for supportive management responses and peer support, access to specialized and confidential trauma-informed mental health services, and reductions in stigma, victim blaming, and other barriers to help-seeking among mental health workers.",
