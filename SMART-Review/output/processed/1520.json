    "Article Title": "The Influence of Exposure to Natural Disasters on Depression and PTSD Symptoms among Firefighters",
    "Abstract": "Introduction: Firefighters represent an important population for understanding the consequences of exposure to potentially traumatic stressors.Hypothesis/Problem: The researchers were interested in the effects of pre-employment disaster exposure on firefighter recruits' depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the first three years of fire service and hypothesized that: (1) disaster-exposed firefighters would have greater depression and PTSD symptoms than non-exposed overall; and (2) depression and PTSD symptoms would worsen over years in fire service in exposed firefighters, but not in their unexposed counterparts.Methods: In a baseline interview, 35 male firefighter recruits from seven US cities reported lifetime exposure to natural disaster. These disaster-exposed male firefighter recruits were matched on age, city, and education with non-exposed recruits.Results: A generalized linear mixed model revealed a significant exposure x time interaction (e(coef) = 1.04; P<.001), such that depression symptoms increased with time for those with pre-employment disaster exposure only. This pattern persisted after controlling for social support from colleagues (e(coefficient) = 1.05; P < .001), social support from families (ecoefficient = 1.04; P = .001), and on-the-job trauma exposure (coefficient = 0.06; e(coefficient) = 1.11; P < .001). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms did not vary significantly between exposure groups at baseline (P = .61).Conclusion: Depression symptoms increased with time for those with pre-employment disaster exposure only, even after controlling for social support. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms did not vary between exposure groups.",
