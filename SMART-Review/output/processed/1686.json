    "Abstract": "Objective COVID-19 has dramatically affected Western Society's relationship with work and contributed to increased worker burnout. Existing studies on burnout have mostly emphasized workplace culture, leadership, and employee engagement as key contributors to burnout. In this cross-sectional study, we examine the associations between Malach-Pines Short Burnout Measure (MPSBM) scores and participant's self reported personal characteristics, financial strain, workplace conditions, work-life balance, and social inclusion among Canadians living during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods To identify the most salient correlates of burnout, Canadian residents, aged 16+, were recruited using paid social media advertisements in French and English to complete a cross-sectional study. Multivariable linear regression and dominance analysis identified the most salient correlates of MPSBM scores. Exposure variables included demographic factors, financial strain, workplace conditions, work-life balance, social support, and loneliness. Results Among 486 participants, family social support (adjusted beta = -0.14, 95%CI = -0.23, -0.05), emotional loneliness (adjusted beta = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35), insufficient sleep (adjusted beta = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.16, 0.60) and me time (adjusted beta = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.42), and indicators of financial security (e.g., owning vs renting; adjusted beta = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.54, -0.17; insufficient pay: adjusted beta = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.54, -0.17) were key burnout indicators. People with a bachelor's degree (vs <= high school diploma; adjusted beta = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.58) also had higher burnout scores. Conclusion Interventions addressing workplace culture, leadership, and other proximal workplace stressors, while important, are likely insufficient to meet the needs of workers. Our findings suggest that broader, holistic multicomponent approaches that address multiple upstream dimensions of health-including mental health-are likely necessary to prevent and reduce burnout.",
