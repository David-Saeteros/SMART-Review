    "Abstract": "Objectives: Multiple studies highlight that individuals undergoing menopause are not receiving sufficient support at work. An improved menopausal experience in the workplace has been found to be associated with increased job satisfaction, increased economic participation and reduced absenteeism. This work was undertaken to explore the impact of menopause on the working lives of NHS staff working in Wales, with specific emphasis on their experience of menopausal symptoms and management strategies in the workplace. Study design: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured focus groups and thematic analysis. 14 women working in the NHS in Wales attended four focus groups, lasting up to 1.5 h. Stem questions focused on participants' positive and negative experiences in the workplace, and their receipt of support. Transcripts were analysed using the framework approach. Results: Three major themes were identified: experiences of menopausal symptoms and symptom management, the impact of menopause on work and the impact of work on the menopause. Menopause symptom experience in the workplace was multifaceted and varied, depending on factors such as ongoing or past symptom experience, expectations, social support and effectiveness of management strategies. Inconsistent information was highlighted as a reason why some participants felt confused both about the symptoms that they could attribute to the menopause and the management strategies available to them. A variety of symptom management strategies had been used by participants, including hormone replacement therapy, flexible working hours, working from home, changes to uniform, peer support and lifestyle changes, with varying levels of success. Some women were reticent to ask for support at work even though they felt the workplace response was likely to be supportive. Almost all the women felt that they had to persuade their GP to prescribe HRT and felt that their doctors were too reticent in prescribing this treatment. Conclusions: Employers have a key role in supporting their staff experiencing menopausal symptoms, and such support has the potential to reduce sickness absence and boost retention. Based on the findings we recommend creating an open culture to break down taboos; protected time for peer support around shared experiences and effective symptom management techniques; and maximising the impact of non-menopause-specific policies such as flexible working to help all staff manage fatigue and become more productive in their roles.",
