    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The therapeutic relationship is often acknowledged as one of the most significant factors in clinical process that influences client outcomes.OBJECTIVE: While considerable research has been conducted on the therapeutic relationship in psychotherapy, there is a paucity of research on the impact of the therapeutic relationship in vocational rehabilitation counseling settings.METHODS: This study explored the relationship between areas of client functioning (individual, interpersonal, social, and overall) and the therapeutic alliance among clients who receive services from the State vocational rehabilitation agency.RESULTS: In this study, younger clients (ages between 16 to 29) reported stronger therapeutic alliance.CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggested that clients' perceived individual, interpersonal and overall functioning have a significant positive relationship with the task and bond components of therapeutic relationship.",
