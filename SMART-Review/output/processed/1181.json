    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most working-age adults with psychiatric disabilities are not employed yet are interested in being in employment. This goal is achievable for the majority who are interested, with the help of international evidence-based practices in vocational rehabilitation. However, these practices are not widely available in developed countries.OBJECTIVE: To identify whether, and how, the availability of evidence-based vocational rehabilitation is linked to government policy.METHODS: A systematic examination of New Zealand's economic and social policy context to understand how it facilitates or hinders evidence-based vocational rehabilitation for people with psychiatric disabilities.RESULTS: The New Zealand policy context is currently hindering the availability of evidence-based vocational rehabilitation for people with psychiatric disabilities. Whilst policy reform has commenced, it has not yet translated into a purchasing framework free of policy conflicts and barriers. Consequently, the proportion of people with psychiatric disabilities not employed and not participating in the labor market is increasing.CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the policy adjustments identified could expand the availability of evidence-based vocational rehabilitation, reducing the disparity between individual vocational goals and actual labor force activity. This in turn could have national social and economic benefits through reduced welfare dependence, reduced health service utilization, and increased labor force participation.",
