    "Abstract": "Context: Newly credentialed athletic trainers (ATs) have reported stress and role ambiguity during the transition to practice. Previous researchers focused on their qualitative experiences, yet no investigators have explored how characteristics such as the setting or type of educational program affect the transition to practice.Objective: To determine how newly credentialed ATs perceived their transition to practice.Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting: Online survey.Patients or Other Participants: Of 1835 newly credentialed ATs (18%) certified and employed between January and September, 332 completed the survey within 3 months of employment (129 men, 203 women; age = 23.58 +/- 2.54 years).Main Outcome Measure(s): The survey consisted of demographic information (eg, employment setting, job title) and 3 sections: (1) comfort level during the transition (CL), (2) feelings of mentorship and support (MS), and (3) feelings of organizational transition. Participants identified their feelings of nervousness, support, and understanding organizational values using a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree). Descriptive statistics were calculated for each survey item. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis (H) tests were used to determine associations between different demographic characteristics and responses regarding orientation and CL, MS, and feelings of organizational transition.Results: Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they felt nervous (n = 264, 79.2%) and that the transition was stressful (n = 227, 68.1%) but they felt prepared for their job (n = 262, 78.7%). No differences in CL were present among settings (H = 5.64, P= .228), job titles (H = 4.88, P= .087), or types of professional program (U= 6488, P= .279). Respondents who were assigned a mentor reported better perceptions of MS (U= 6250, P < .001). Most participants felt that supervisors adequately explained administrative procedures during orientation (n = 169, 54.3%) and felt they were adequately oriented to organizational values (n = 252, 75.7%).Conclusions: New ATs felt nervous when entering their new role, but having a mentor and receiving a detailed orientation helped alleviate stress during the transition to practice.",
