    "Abstract": "Post-employment support is an essential part of supported employment for people with psychiatric disabilities. However, little information is available about how best to provide this support. The aim of this study was to collect the views of experienced practitioners on how to conceptualise and plan post-employment support in the workplace. Seventy-eight staff of a large supported employment service voluntarily participated in a nominal group technique. Participants were encouraged to provide suggestions to a series of questions and then their responses were compiled into a two-page checklist. This consists of 32 prompts and is organised into four themes: (1) preparing for a workplace visit; (2) conducting a workplace visit; (3) conducting a situational assessment; and (4) strengthening relationships with employers. This checklist has good face validity and appears useful for guiding employment specialists when preparing for a workplace visit. Cautious utilization is recommended as there is no evidence yet to suggest that planning post-employment support in this manner is more effective than not doing so.",
