    "Article Title": "From Victims of Market Forces to Entrepreneurs: Rethinking the Role of Supported Employment and Social Entrepreneurship in Behavioral Health Interventions",
    "Abstract": "The social work literature is largely silent regarding the role of supported employment and social entrepreneurship in promoting behavioral health. This article establishes a case for viewing clients with behavioral health challenges as entrepreneurs who can use employment and social entrepreneurship to improve health, mental health, and economic well-being. The author identifies the relevance of employment and social entrepreneurship to behavioral health by drawing on theories of recovery and rehabilitation and community, economic, and social development. Changes to social work education, research, and practice are recommended to establish a professional niche in integrating employment in behavioral health interventions.",
