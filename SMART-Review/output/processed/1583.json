    "Article Title": "Participation restrictions in patients with psychiatric and/or cognitive disabilities: Preliminary results for an ICF-derived assessment tool",
    "Abstract": "Participation in community life is a major challenge for most people with psychiatric and/or cognitive disabilities. Current assessments of participation lack a theoretical basis. However, the new International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a relevant framework.Aims. - The present study used an ICF-derived assessment tool to activity limitations and participation restrictions in two groups of participants with disabilities linked to schizophrenia or traumatic brain injury respectively.Methods. - Twenty-six items (related to six ICF sections) were selected by reviewing the literature and gathering the clinician's opinions and representatives of patient associations. These items, yielded an ordinal rating of activity limitations, participation restrictions and contextual factors (social support, attitudes and, systems & politics). Special attention was paid to contextual and environmental factors. The final checklist (called the Grid for Measurements of Activity and Participation, G-MAP) was administered to 16 participants with traumatic brain injury (the TBI group) and 15 participants with schizophrenic disorders (the SD group). Psychometric assessments of cognition and, neurobehavioural, psychological and psychosocial functioning were also performed.Results. - The internal consistencies for activity limitations (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.89) and participation restriction (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.89) were satisfactory. We did not observe any significant differences between the two groups in terms of the psychometric test results. The G-MAP scores demonstrated that the two groups were confronted with the same limitations in self care, domestic life, leisure and community life (i.e., the intergroup differences were not statistically significant in Mann-Whitney tests). However, interpersonal relationships and economic and social productivity appeared to be more severely limited in the SD group than in the TBI group. Similarly, participation restrictions in domestic life, interpersonal relationships and economic and social productivity were more severe in the SD group than in the TBI group.Conclusion. - G-MAP is a useful, feasible, relevant tool for performing a detailed, individualized assessment of participation restrictions in people with psychiatric and/or cognitive disabilities.
