    "Article Title": "Career Development in Transitional Work Settings: A Qualitative Investigation Among Veterans and Vocational Counselors",
    "Abstract": "Veterans living with mental health conditions have ambitious career goals and want support to find employment that meets their interests and preferences. Despite calls from researchers to invest and commit to career development research and practice for individuals living with psychiatric conditions, we still do not have empirically tested models for facilitating career development among individuals with mental health conditions, especially veterans. This qualitative study investigates the career development needs and recommended intervention strategies of veterans living with mental health conditions. Vocational counselors from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and veterans receiving vocational rehabilitation services (N = 13) participated in semi-structured focus groups. Findings illuminate the tasks, barriers, interventions, implementation strategies, and transitional work context that hinder and support career development of veterans with mental health conditions. Findings offer theoretical and applied guidance to researchers and counselors regarding career development of veterans living with mental health conditions.",
