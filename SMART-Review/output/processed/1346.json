    "Abstract": "Topic: Evidence-based Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment provides opportunities to individualize supports for parents with mental health conditions who are vulnerable to financial insecurity and family instability. Purpose: Adults living with serious mental health conditions may have goals related to both work and parenting. IPS employment specialists can capitalize on our understanding of the challenges faced by parents living with serious mental health conditions to improve the economic wellbeing of these individuals and their families. Sources Used: Data include a summary of analyses of the U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health as well as first-person accounts from parents and employment specialists. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Empirical and anecdotal evidence support the relevance of discussing goals for parenting and family life with adults living with mental health conditions in the context of job assessment, placement, and support to promote goal achievement in both role domains employment and parenting.",
