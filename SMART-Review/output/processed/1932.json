    "Abstract": "Individualized Placement and Support-Supported Employment (IPS-SE) has been shown to be successful assisting those with mental illness and/or substance use disorders who have histories of incarceration find employment. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a hybrid IPS-SE program for working with individuals with violent and non-violent offenses. This study compared two cohorts of U.S. veterans with histories of prison incarceration, 60 receiving IPS-SE plus a vocational group and 59 receiving group only. Follow-up was six months. Those receiving IPS-SE had superior employment outcomes compared to those receiving group alone within both those convicted of violent and non-violent offenses. The findings here highlight the benefits of IPS-SE across the type of crimes convicted.",
