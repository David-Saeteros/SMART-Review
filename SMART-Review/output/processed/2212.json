    "Article Title": "The development of a new labour framework during the Second Republic in Spain: the Central Service for job placement and defence against unemployment",
    "Abstract": "The Great Depression affected the Spanish economy, sharply increasing the number of unemployed workers, known as the 'sin trabajo'. In an effort to address problems with the labour market, the Central Office for Job Placement and Defence against Unemployment was established in 1931 for the purpose, in Niceto Alcala-Zamora's words, of heading off 'regrettable passions and misadventures of a social or political nature'. The 'reformist challenge' to the traditional social order would commence that same year, when the PSOE's Largo Caballero became head of the Ministry of Labour. The staff of the Central Office for Job Placement were aware of proposals by Keynes and other economists regarding this issue, so it can be said that in addition to responding to the urgent social pressure of the moment, the employment policies implemented also sought added legitimacy in the context of theoretical trends that enjoyed consensus at that time.",
