    "Article Title": "COVID-19 and healthcare worker mental well-being: Comparative case studies on interventions in six countries",
    "Abstract": "Healthcare worker (HCW) mental well-being has become a global public health priority as health systems seek to strengthen their resilience in the face of the COVID19 pandemic. Analysing data from the Health System Response Monitor, we present six case studies (Denmark, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Romania, and the United Kingdom) as a comparative review of policy interventions supporting HCW mental health during the pandemic. The results illustrate a wide range of interventions. While Denmark and the United Kingdom built on pre-existing structures to support HCW mental wellbeing during the pandemic, the other countries required new interventions. Across all cases, there was a reliance on self-care resources, online training tools, and remote professional support.Based on our analysis, we develop four policy recommendations for the future of HCW mental health supports. First, HCW mental health should be seen as a core facet of health workforce capacity. Second, effective mental health supports requires an integrated psychosocial approach that acknowledges the importance of harm prevention strategies and organisational resources (psychological first aid) alongside targeted professional interventions. Third, personal, professional and practical obstacles to take-up of mental health supports should be addressed. Fourth, any specific support or intervention targeting HCW's mental health is connected to, and dependent on, wider structural and employment factors (e.g. system resourcing and organisation) that determine the working conditions of HCWs.",
