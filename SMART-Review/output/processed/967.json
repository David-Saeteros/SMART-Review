    "Abstract": "This study aims to identify clinical and socio-demographic variables associated with the outcome of vocational rehabilitation programs (VRPs). All users of an Italian Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) included in VRPs delivered according to the model of Supported Employment in years 2011-2016 were retrospectively enrolled. Fifty users who ended the program with employment were compared with fifty users who dropped out, with respect to clinical and socio-demographic variables. VRPs lasting less than 6 months and oriented toward the competitive labor market had a higher probability of employment. Among users who successfully ended the VRP, the median of health interventions significantly decreased after employment. In the same group of users, less non-health interventions strictly linked to the VRP were required, when compared with users who dropped out. We conclude that employment is associated with improvement of users' clinical conditions and reduced workload for the CMHC.",
