    "Abstract": "Evidence-based practice initiatives pertaining to helping people recover from severe mental illnesses have designated certain practices as evidence-based (e.g., supported employment, intensive case management) due to their ability to generate positive outcomes in randomized trials. These practices are often described mostly in terms of their program structures, such as staffing or caseload size. However, evidence-based practice initiatives would benefit from deliberately integrating the factors in the helping process that can occur within each program, and which other mental health research has shown to foster change and growth (i.e., relationship variables, skill teaching strategies, hope-engendering techniques). This article overviews the research underlying those evidence-based helping processes that have often been overlooked in the study of evidence-based practices with respect to interventions for people with severe mental illnesses. Implications for policy and rehabilitation counseling are addressed to expand the evidence base to include evidence-based processes for rehabilitation counseling and research.",
