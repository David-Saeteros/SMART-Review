    "Abstract": "Objective: This study investigated the relationship between work-related factors at baseline and the risk of common mental disorder at 12 month follow-up among a cohort of junior doctors.Method: The data comprised the junior doctor respondents from two annual waves of the 'Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life' (MABEL) survey, a national longitudinal cohort of Australian doctors. Individual and work-related risk factors were assessed at baseline and the mental health outcome of caseness of common mental disorder (CMD) was assessed using the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale at 12-month follow-up. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regressions were conducted to estimate the association between each baseline variable and the likelihood of CMD caseness at follow-up 1 year later.Results: Among 383 junior doctors, 24 (6%) had CMD 1 year later. Five work-related baseline variables were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of CMD 1 year later in adjusted models; lack of social support in work location (odds ratios (OR) = 6.11; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = [2.52, 14.81]), work-life imbalance (OR = 4.50; 95% CI = [1.31, 15.46]), poor peer support network in the workplace (OR = 2.61; 95% CI = [1.08, 6.27]), perceptions of patient expectations (OR = 2.46; 95% CI = [1.06, 5.71]) and total weekly work hours (OR 1.04; 95% CI = [1.01, 1.07]; p = 0.002)in models adjusting for gender.Conclusion: These results identify key modifiable work-related factors that are associated with junior doctors' future mental health. Our findings suggest the need for a greater focus upon interpersonal factors and work-life balance in multi-level interventions while continuing to address workplace and system-level factors to prevent future mental disorder in junior doctors.",
