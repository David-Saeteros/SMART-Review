    "Abstract": "Objective To explore how stakeholders responded to research evidence regarding supported employment (e.g., vocational rehabilitation), and ways evidence could be incorporated into policy and action. Data sources Qualitative data were collected from three stakeholder groups-people with lived experience of mental health challenges, community health advocates, and state health policy makers. Study design This study consisted of two sequential steps. First, three focus groups were conducted after presenting stakeholder groups (inclusive of 22 participants) with simulation data showing that improvement in employment status had a stronger impact on mental health than improvement in education or income for racially/ethnically diverse groups. Second, with guidance from focus group findings, researchers conducted additional in-depth interviews (n = 19) to gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges related to incorporating these findings into policy and practice. Data collection/extraction methods Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted, audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Principal findings People with lived experience described the positive effect of employment in their own life while highlighting the need to increase workplace accommodations and social supports for those with mental health challenges. Across stakeholder groups, participants emphasized the need for linguistic and cultural competence to promote equity in delivery of supported employment programs. Stakeholders also underscored that centralizing existing resources and using evidence-based approaches are crucial for successful implementation. Conclusion Implementing effective supported employment programs should focus on meeting the specific needs of target individuals, as many of those needs are not considered in current employment-related programming. Collecting information from diverse users of research demonstrates what other aspects of supported employment are required for the likelihood of successful uptake. Implementation and dissemination efforts need to fortify collaborations and knowledge transfer between stakeholders to optimize supported employment and mental health resources.",
