    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Notwithstanding efforts by vocational services to assist Australians with mental illness into employment many of these consumers remain unemployed.OBJECTIVE: To inform policymakers and practitioners of a disability employment services reform framework that endeavours to help more consumers who are experiencing mental illness to attain and retain employment.METHODS: Thematic analysis was directed to summarize results obtained from a narrative literature review of disability employment service reforms utilising Scopus, Medline and Pubmed databases and including articles published between 2000 and 2016.RESULTS: Research results reveal a preparative framework covering three levels of disability employment services reform for consumers with mental illness.CONCLUSION: This research makes important theoretical contributions across three areas. First this study reveals individualised, integrated and outcome-oriented services as dimensions of disability employment services reform that warrant greater government investment, practitioner focus and consumer involvement. Second recognising that none of these service reforms are immune from challenges which may hinder their effectiveness, future research is needed to identify evidence-based mitigation measures. Finally with individualised services positioned at the nucleus of the reform framework, integrated services and outcome-oriented reforms should be operationalised in ways that remain sensitive to the principle of strength-based support.",
