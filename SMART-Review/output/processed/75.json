    "Article Title": "Total Metacognitive Capacity Predicts Competitive Employment Acquisition Across 6 Months in Adults With Serious Mental Illness Receiving Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services",
    "Abstract": "Deficits in metacognitive capacity are common among people with serious mental illness (SMI), although there is a gap in knowledge regarding how these impairments predict later functioning, especially employment. This study aimed to prospectively examine the relationship between metacognitive capacity and 6-month competitive employment attainment in adults with SMI who were participating in a study testing a cognitive behavioral therapy intervention added to supported employment services. Sixty-seven participants with complete data at baseline and the 6-month follow-up comprised the sample. Data were analyzed using stepwise logistic regression covarying for work history and study assignment. Results indicate that total metacognitive capacity at baseline significantly predicted employment acquisition at 6 months; the final model correctly classified 83.3% of participants who obtained work. In conclusion, these findings suggest that better overall metacognitive capacity may be key for future work functioning. Thus, interventions that target metacognitive capacity may lead to enhancements in community outcomes.",
