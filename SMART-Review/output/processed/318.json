    "Abstract": "Objective: To provide a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of an online resource for job seekers with multiple sclerosis (MS).Design: Randomized controlled design.Setting: Community-dwelling cohort.Participants: Adults (N=95) with relapsing-remitting or progressive MS were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Forty-five accessed an email delivered, 7 module resource, Work and MS, over a 4 week period. Waitlist control participants (n=50) were offered the opportunity to access Work and MS 4 weeks postenrollment.Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes focused on vocational interests (My Vocational Situation Scale) and self-efficacy in job-seeking activities (Job-Procurement Self Efficacy Scale). Secondary outcomes focused on perceived workplace difficulties (Multiple Sclerosis Work Difficulties Questionnaire [MSWDQ]), optimism (Life Orientation Test Revised), and mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).Results: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed pre-post gains: participants who accessed Work and MS reported improved confidence in their career goals (My Vocational Situation Scale g=.55; 95% confidence interval [CI],.14-.96; P=.008) and positively reappraised potential workplace difficulties (MSWDQ g range,.42-.47; P range,.023-.042). The effect on job self-efficacy was not significant, but changed in the expected direction (g=.17; 95% CI,.23 to.57; P=.409). Completer data revealed larger, significant effect estimates (g range,.52-.64; P range,.009-.035).Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary support for the utility of a job information resource, Work and MS, to augment existing employment services. The results also suggest the need to test employment-ready interventions in a larger study population. This might include the addition of online peer support to increase intervention compliance.
