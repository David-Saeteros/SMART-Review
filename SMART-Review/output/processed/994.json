    "Article Title": "Prevalence and Determinants of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms among Transgender People: Results of a Survey",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: The aim was to investigate the prevalence of probable depression and probable anxiety and to investigate the determinants of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms among transgender people. Methods: In this Transgender Survey (n = 104) we included transgender people who had joined self-help groups to obtain and share information about the gender-affirming surgeries performed at the Division of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Data collection took place between April and October 2022. To measure probable depression, the patient health questionnaire-9 was used. The generalized anxiety disorder-7 was used to quantify probable anxiety. Results: The prevalence of probable depression was 33.3% and it was 29.6% for probable anxiety. Multiple linear regressions showed that both more depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with younger age (beta = -0.16, p < 0.01; beta = -0.14, p < 0.01), being unemployed (e.g., full-time employed compared to unemployment: beta = -3.05, p < 0.05; beta = -2.69, p < 0.05), worse self-rated health (beta = -3.31, p < 0.001; beta = -1.88, p < 0.05), and having at least one chronic disease (beta = 3.71, p < 0.01; beta = 2.61, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Remarkably high prevalence rates were identified among transgender people. Furthermore, risk factors of poor mental health (e.g., unemployment or younger age) were identified-which can help to address transgender people at risk for poor mental health.",
