    "Abstract": "Aim. To study the influence of socio-psychological factors, factors associated with the disease, the patient, and psychopathological disorders on the treatment compliance.Methods. Structured interviews were conducted with 151 patients (57 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, 57 - gastroesophageal reflux disease, 37 peptic gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer). Compliance was assessed using Morisky-Green validated test. Patients were divided into three groups: the first group compliant patients, the second risk group, the third group non-compliant patients.Results. Negative effect on compliance had the following socio-psychological factors: employment, lack of higher education, age from 40 to 49 years, non-constructive model of parent-child relationships, conflict relationships in their own family. Overprotective parenting was mentioned more often in the third group than in the first (20.7 and 42.3%, p <0.05). Patients in the second and third groups reported frequent conflict situations in the family (18.2 and 15.4%, respectively), none of the patients in the first group reported intrafamily conflicts. Multiple hospitalizations in different hospitals, change of physician, disease duration for more than 2 years, the lack of awareness about the disease and treatment was also associated with low treatment compliance. Full-scale psychopathological syndromes were not identified only in 12.6% of patients. Depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobias, panic disorder, schizotypal and obsessive compulsive personality disorder, hypochondriacal disorder and mild cognitive impairment were found the most frequently. Among high-risk and non-compliant patients paranoid personality disorder (15.9 and 16.7%, respectively) was often found, in a group of compliant patients paranoid disorder was not observed. High frequency of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder was registered in risk group (45.5%).Conclusion. The influence of certain socio-psychological factors, factors associated with the disease, the patient and the psychopathological disorders presence on the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal diseases was identified, and therefore comprehensive gastroenterologist and psychiatrist monitoring with the subsequent treatment of psychopathological syndromes is necessary.",
