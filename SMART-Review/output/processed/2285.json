    "Abstract": "Few studies have examined developmentally relevant sources of resilience, such as peer social support, among young sexual minority men (SMM) of color experiencing discrimination and mental health distress. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the role of peer social support in the association between discrimination and mental health distress in a sample of young SMM of color. Ninety-four cisgender young SMM of color (aged 16-29) were recruited through community-based organizations in the New York City metropolitan area as part of an effectiveness trial of a tailored Motivational Interviewing intervention. Participants completed a baseline survey that included measures of school/workplace ethnoracial discrimination, sexual orientation discrimination, peer social support, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results of multivariable models indicated some evidence of the stress-buffering effects of peer social support. School/workplace ethnoracial discrimination was negatively associated with symptoms of anxiety (B = -0.12, SE = 0.03, p < .001) and depression (B = 0.44, SE = 0.15, p = .005) among young SMM of color with lower levels of peer social support. Peer social support did not moderate the association between sexual orientation discrimination and either depression or anxiety. Findings provide some evidence of the protective role of peer social support. We discuss the implications of the results for practice with young SMM of color with mental health distress.",
