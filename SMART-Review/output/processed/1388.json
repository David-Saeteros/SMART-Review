    "Article Title": "Real time detection of amphetamine in oral fluids by MicroNIR/Chemometrics",
    "Abstract": "In this work, a novel coupled approach MicroNIR/Chemometrics based on a miniaturized and portable spectrometer is proposed for the on site detection of amphetamines (AMP) in non pretreated oral fluids. In particular, the coupling of MicroNIR with chemometrics was investigated with the aim of developing a fast and accurate approach able to perform the on-site prediction of AMP abuse. A predictive model to be used in real cases was developed by collecting specimens from volunteers and spiked samples with increasing amounts of AMP were prepared to optimize calibration. Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Partial Least Square regression (PIS) were involved to detect and quantify AMP. Results demonstrated that MicroNIR/Chemometric platform is statistically able to identify AMP abuse in simulated oral fluid samples containing, with the accuracy and sensitivity of the actual proposed official reference methods. The method was checked against false positive and true positive response and results proved to be those required for confirmatory analyses. This method would permit to simplify AMP abuse monitoring for roadside drug testing or workplace surveillance and may be of help at first aid points.",
