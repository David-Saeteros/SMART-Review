    "Abstract": "Young adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often experience employment difficulties. Using Rehabilitation Service Administration data (RSA-911), this study investigated the service patterns and factors related to the employment outcomes of individuals with ASD in different age groups. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of demographic and vocational rehabilitation (VR) service variables on employment outcomes in each age group. The results show that transition youth made up the largest portion of VR service users among the ASD population, yet they have the worst employment outcomes across all age groups. Factors that are significantly associated with increased odds for employment in each age group were identified. Implications from systemic, practical, and research perspectives are also provided.",
