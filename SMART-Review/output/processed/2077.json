    "Article Title": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia: the great unmet need",
    "Abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is present in almost all persons with the disorder and can be a substantial obstacle to efforts in the recovery process. In clinical research, cognition is assessed through neuropsychological testing as well as by different types of structured instruments focusing on function. Although nonpharmacological interventions such as cognitive remediation have been therapeutic, particularly in combination with vocational rehabilitation and supported employment, these modalities are not always easy to access. Pharmacological interventions are in development and have principally focused on the dopamine, glutamate, and acetylcholine neurotransmitter systems, aiming to target the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its interactions with other brain regions.",
