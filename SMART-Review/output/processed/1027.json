    "Abstract": "This study examines predictors, moderators, and treatment parameters associated with two key child outcomes in a recent clinical trial comparing the effects of a modular treatment that was applied by study clinicians in the community (COMM) or a clinic (CLINIC) for children with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD). Based on a literature review, moderator and predictor variables across child, parent, and family domains were examined in relation to changes in parental ratings of the severity of externalizing behavior problems or the number of ODD and CD symptoms endorsed on psychiatric interview at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 36-month posttreatment follow-up. In addition, associations between parameters of treatment (e.g., hours of child, parent, and parent-child treatment received, treatment completion, referral for additional services at discharge) and child outcomes were explored. Path models identified few moderators (e.g., level of child impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, level of family conflict) and several predictors (child trauma history, family income, parental employment, parental depression) of treatment response. Treatment response was also related to a few treatment parameters (e.g., hours of child and parent treatment received, treatment completion, referral for additional services at discharge). We discuss the implications of these findings for maximizing the benefits of modular treatment by optimizing or personalizing intervention approaches for children with behavior disorders.",
