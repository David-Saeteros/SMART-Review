    "Abstract": "This study aimed to identify characteristics of workers experiencing health problems without a decline in labor productivity to address presenteeism. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 554 workers in Japan, with a median age of 43 years. Participants reported any health problems in the past month, along with job stressors, stress responses, social support, and job and life satisfaction using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. They were categorized into three groups: no symptoms, pre-presenteeism (health problems without work impact), and presenteeism (health problems with work impact). Results showed that 30.1% were in prepresenteeism and 52.0% in presenteeism. Stress responses and social support were linked to both pre-presenteeism and presenteeism, while job stressors and job and life satisfaction were only associated with presenteeism. These findings offer insights for preventing presenteeism.",
