    "Article Title": "Prevalence of depression in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Spain (the DIADEMA Study) : results from the MADIABETES cohort",
    "Abstract": "Objective To estimate the prevalence of depression in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to identify sociodemographic, clinical and psychological factors associated with depression in this population. Additionally, we examine the annual incidence rate of depression among patients with T2DM.Methods We performed a large prospective cohort study of patients with T2DM from the Madrid Diabetes Study. The first recruitment drive included 3443 patients. The second recruitment drive included 727 new patients. Data have been collected since 2007 (baseline visit) and annually during the follow-up period (since 2008).Results Depression was prevalent in 20.03% of patients (n=592; 95%CI 18.6% to 21.5%) and was associated with previous personal history of depression (OR 6.482; 95%CI 5.138 to 8.178), mental health status below mean (OR 1.423; 95%CI 1.452 to 2.577), neuropathy (OR 1.951; 95%CI 1.423 to 2.674), fair or poor self-reported health status (OR 1.509; 95%CI 1.209 to 1.882), treatment with oral antidiabetic agents plus insulin (OR 1.802; 95%CI 1.364 to 2.380), female gender (OR 1.333; 95%CI 1.009 to 1.761) and blood cholesterol level (OR 1.005; 95%CI 1.002 to 1.009). The variables inversely associated with depression were: being in employment (OR 0.595; 95%CI 0.397 to 0.894), low physical activity (OR 0.552; 95%CI 0.408 to 0.746), systolic blood pressure (OR 0.982; 95%CI 0.971 to 0.992) and social support (OR 0.978; 95%CI 0.963 to 0.993). In patients without depression at baseline, the incidence of depression after 1year of follow-up was 1.20% (95% CI 1.11% to 2.81%).Conclusions Depression is very prevalent among patients with T2DM and is associated with several key diabetes-related outcomes. Our results suggest that previous mental status, self-reported health status, gender and several diabetes-related complications are associated with differences in the degree of depression. These findings should alert practitioners to the importance of detecting depression in patients with T2DM.",
