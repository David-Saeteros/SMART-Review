    "Abstract": "Background: Several studies have demonstrated the existence of psychological pathologies and psycho -social risks among seafarers, particularly merchant navy officers. To date, there is no study of merchant navy officer cadets. First aims are to assess anxiety and depression disorders, framework, work strain and social support in this population.Materials and methods: A questionnaire including demographic and sailing data to which we added the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and Karasek questionnaire was developed. All students were approached and completed the questionnaire anonymously by electronic means.Results: One hundred and seventy questionnaires could be included. The population was predominantly male (76.4%), and the average age of the students was 21.7 years. The means of the HAD anxiety and HAD depression were 6.9 and 5.37, respectively. According to Karasek classification, we noted that the `acti-ve class was the most represented with 29.4% of students, followed by the `high strain and `low strain classes with 27.6%. The `passive class was the least represented with 15.3%.Conclusions: We found a predominance of anxiety disorders but few signs of depression. Signs of `high strain according to Karasek were found in 27.6% of the population of these young officers. Job demand was linked to mean of anxiety and depression disorders declared in HAD questionnaire. Being a woman was associated with anxiety but not depression symptoms. Prevention programme to decrease the level of job demand and increase decision latitude and social support seems relevant for mental health disor-ders in merchant officers.",
