    "Abstract": "DEFINING THE PROBLEM: A growing body of evidence highlights the need for wellness programs to support health care professionals. Although much of the existing literature centers on practicing physicians and physician trainees, there is growing awareness that these challenges are not unique to physicians and affect all members of the health care team. Traumatic and stressful events will always be a part of health care; how these events are addressed on a personal and team level is essential to the success of a health care system. A Resiliency Center was developed on the basis of the specific concerns and strengths of local stakeholders to support the well-being of employees at University of Utah Health.INITIAL APPROACH: The initial approach to evaluating and supporting faculty wellness began concurrent with planning for the Resiliency Center in 2016. Stakeholders were brought together by leaders in Health Sciences to propose a Resiliency Center. Initial data gathering was performed with several survey tools, including the American Medical Association's Mini Z.PLANNED INITIATIVES: The Resiliency Center, which is housed in the Office of Wellness and Integrative Health, is intended to serve as an overarching structure to help coordinate the faculty and staff wellness initiatives currently in existence and fill identified gaps. The four pillars of the Center are wellness initiatives, communication skills training, peer support, and an on-site Employee Assistance Program.NEXT STEPS: The current focus is on program development and outreach, with plans to measure the impact of the Center.",
