    "Abstract": "PurposeFor persons on disability benefits who are facing multiple problems, active labour market policies seem less successful. Besides health problems, these people perceive personal, social, and environmental problems. Since very little is known about these non-medical problems our aim was to explore the prevalence of clients experiencing multiple problems, the types and number of perceived problems, combinations of perceived problems, and associated characteristics in a group of work disability benefit recipients.MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional study, using self-reported data on perceived problems and socio-demographics, and register data from the Dutch Social Security Institute on diagnosed diseases and employment status. A convenient group of labour experts recruited eligible clients on work disability benefit.ResultsOf the 207 persons on work disability benefit, 87% perceived having multiple problems. Most reported problems were related to physical (76%) or mental (76%) health. Health problems most frequently occurred together with a mismatch in education, financial problems, or care for family members. Clients with lower education experienced significantly more problems than clients with an intermediate or high educational level.ConclusionsClients with multiple problems face severe and intertwined problems in different domains of life, and need tailored multi-actor work disability management.",
