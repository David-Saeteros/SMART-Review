    "Abstract": "People with serious mental illness (SMI) are frequently unemployed, despite their willingness to work. Several employment interventions approaches have proven efficacy; however, work integration rates for people with SMI continue to be low. In total, 145 participants with a SMI completed a survey, answering questions regarding their personal information, work history, whether they received supports towards work integration, and their functional level. In addition, clinical records were accessed to verify and complete clinical history. A quantitative descriptive approach was used to analyze the data. No significant differences were found between those who were working and who were not, based on age, gender, educational level, living situation, and suicide risk. Those who were working presented higher levels of functional capacity than those who were not working. Factors associated with employment outcomes continue to remain unclear, adding value to the role that the different supports towards work integration may have.",
