    "Abstract": "Aim To evaluate parental mental health monitoring during follow-up care for very preterm (VPT) infants, describe symptoms of anxiety and depression and risk factors for mothers and fathers at 1 and 12 months of corrected age. Methods Parents completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Psychological symptoms and risk factors were analysed within and between mothers and fathers. Results In 4 years, the monitoring reached 1260 (48%) families. Of these, 693 mothers and 340 fathers (300 couples) completed the HADS twice. At 1 month, 22% and 15% of the mothers and 10% and 9% of the fathers, respectively, reported elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. At 12 months, these rates were significantly reduced to 14% and 9% for mothers and 5% and 4% for fathers respectively. Within couples, anxiety and depression were positively associated. At 12 months, in 20% of the couples, one or both parents reported elevated symptoms. Risk factors were length of hospital stay, migration background, educational level and employment status. Conclusion The mental health of parents of VPT infants improved, but elevated symptoms were still observed in 17% of included families after one year. Acknowledging and remediating parental mental health remain essential during follow-up care.",
