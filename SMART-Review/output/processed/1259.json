    "Abstract": "Objectives: To assess occupational burnout (OB) changes among Brazilian healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 onset to 6 months later (T1) and identify risk and protective factors. Methods: Using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and hierarchical multivariate linear regression in a two-stage online survey (initial n = 1054; T1 n = 316), this study examined the impact of various factors on OB. Results: Significant increases in personal and work-related OB were observed by T1. Psychiatric diagnosis and workload emerged as risk factors (P < 0.01), while having a partner, good family relations, workplace well-being, and adequate sleep were protective (P < 0.001). Conclusions: OB levels among Brazilian HCWs increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should target personal and organizational wellness to alleviate burnout, emphasizing the importance of strong relationships, workplace health, and good sleep practices.",
