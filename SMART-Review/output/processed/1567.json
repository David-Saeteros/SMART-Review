    "Abstract": "Aim Peer support worker (PSW) roles are gaining recognition internationally as a valuable component in mental health service delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the views of mental health voluntary sector staff regarding the emergence of this role.Method A qualitative research design was used. A purposive sample was employed. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 10 staff members in various positions in two voluntary mental health organizations. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically.Results Views varied on the PSW role with some participants stating that it was tokenistic, whereas others highlighted the value of its contribution. Participants' expressed concerns regarding professional boundaries and organizational cultural challenges that PSWs may encounter in their role. The provision of reasonable adjustments was recommended as an integral support mechanism.Conclusion Successful integration of the PSW requires careful consideration of the role, the workplace environment and the unique needs of the peer, to prevent the role becoming constrained and diluted.Implications for practice The PSW role may impact the traditional delivery of mental health nursing services. It is therefore essential that nurses are cognizant of these potential challenges to successfully facilitate the integration of PSWs in practice.",
