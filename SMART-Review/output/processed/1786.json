    "Article Title": "Abstinence-contingent wage supplements for adults experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder: A randomized clinical trial",
    "Abstract": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of abstinence-contingent wage supplements in promoting alcohol abstinence and employment in adults experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder. A randomized clinical trial was conducted from 2019 to 2022. After a 1-month Induction period, 119 participants were randomly assigned to a Usual Care Control group (n = 57) or an Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplement group (n = 62). Usual Care participants were offered counseling and referrals to employment and treatment programs. Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplement participants could earn stipends for working with an employment specialist and wage supplements for working in a community job but had to maintain abstinence from alcohol as determined by transdermal alcohol concentration monitoring devices to maximize pay. Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplement participants reported significantly higher rates of alcohol abstinence than Usual Care participants during the 6-month intervention (82.8% vs. 60.2% of months, OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.8 to 6.3, p < .001). Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplement participants were also significantly more likely to obtain employment (51.3% vs. 31.6% of months, OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.4, p < .001) and live out of poverty (38.2% vs. 16.7% of months, OR = 3.7, 95% CI 2.0 to 7.1, p < .001) than Usual Care participants. These findings suggest that Abstinence-Contingent Wage Supplements can promote alcohol abstinence and employment in adults experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder.
