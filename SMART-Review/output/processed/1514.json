    "Abstract": "Objectives To determine the impact of genetic muscle disorders and identify the sociodemographic, illness, and symptom factors influencing quality of life. Methods Adults (aged 16-90 years) with a confirmed clinical or molecular diagnosis of a genetic muscle disorder identified as part of a nationwide prevalence study were invited to complete an assessment of the impact of their condition. Quality of life was measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. Impact was measured via the prevalence of symptoms and comparisons of quality of life against New Zealand norms. Multivariate regression models were used to identify the most significant predictors of quality of life domains. Results 490/596 participants completed the assessment (82.2% consent rate). Quality of life was lower than the general population on physical (t = 9.37 p < 0.0001, d = 0.54) social (t = 2.27 p = 0.02, d = 0.13) and environmental domains (t = 2.28 p = 0.02, d = 0.13), although effect sizes were small. No difference was found on the psychological domain (t = - 1.17 p = 0.24, d = 0.07). Multivariate regression models (predicting 42%-64% of the variance) revealed personal factors (younger age, being in employment and in a relationship), symptoms (lower pain, fatigue, and sleep difficulties), physical health (no need for ventilation support, fewer activity limitations and no comorbidities), and psychosocial factors (lower depression, anxiety, behavioural dyscontrol and higher self-efficacy, satisfaction with health care and social support) contributed to improved quality of life. Conclusions A range of factors influence the quality of life in adults diagnosed with a genetic muscle disorder and some may serve as targets for multi-faceted intervention.",
