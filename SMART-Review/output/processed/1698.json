    "Abstract": "Background: Substance use is a public crisis in the U.S. Substance use can be understood as a series of events in the life course, from initiation to mortality. Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) have increasingly been recognized as essential contributors to individuals' health. This scoping review aims to examine available evidence of SDoH impact on the life course of substance use disorder (SUD). Methods: This study identified peer-reviewed articles that reported longitudinal studies with SDoH factors as independent variables and substance use and disorders as dependent variables from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The reported associations between SDoH and substance use stages over the life course were narratively and graphically summarized. Results: Among the 50 studies identified, ten revealed parental monitoring/support and early childhood education as protective factors, while negative peer influences and neighborhood instability were risk factors of substance use initiation. Nineteen articles reported factors associated with escalation in substance use, including unemployment, neighborhood vulnerability, negative peer influence, violence/trauma, and criminal justice system (CJS) involvement. Ten articles suggested that employment, social support, urban living, and low-barrier medication treatment facilitated treatment participation, while stigma and CJS involvement had negative impact on treatment trajectory. Social support and employment could foster progress in recovery and CJS involvement and unstable housing deterred recovery. Four studies suggested that unemployment, unstable housing, CJS involvement, and lack of social support were associated with overdose and mortality. Conclusions: This review underscores the influence of social networks and early life experiences on the life course of SUD. Future SDoH research should investigate overdose and mortality and the impact of broader upstream SDoH on SUD. Interventions addressing these social factors are needed to mitigate their detrimental effects on the trajectories of SUD over the life course.",
