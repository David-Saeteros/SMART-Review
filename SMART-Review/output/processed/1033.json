    "Article Title": "Cognitive remediation for schizophrenia: An expert working group white paper on core techniques",
    "Abstract": "Cognitive remediation is now widely recognized as an effective treatment for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Its effects are meaningful, durable, and related to improvements in everyday functional outcomes. As with many therapies, the evolution of cognitive remediation has resulted in treatment programs that use a variety of specific techniques, yet share common core principles. This paper is the product of a cognitive remediation expert working group consensus meeting to identify core features of the treatment and produce recommendations for its design, conduct, reporting, and implementation. Four techniques were identified as core features of cognitive remediation: facilitation by a therapist, cognitive exercise, procedures to develop problem-solving strategies, and procedures to facilitate transfer to real world functioning. Treatment techniques within each of these core features are presented to facilitate decisions for clinical trials and implementation in clinical settings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.
