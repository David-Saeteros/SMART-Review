    "Abstract": "Objective:We assessed the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and organizational factors that predicted job satisfaction among long-term care employees.Methods:Baseline data were used to describe characteristics that influence job satisfaction. Using a forced linear regression model, while controlling for age and job title, we assessed if higher physical activity levels, fewer symptoms of depression, stress, and/or anxiety (ie, decreased mood), less back pain, stronger social support, and reports of low work demands were associated with higher job satisfaction.Results:Mood (=-0.412, P=0.003) explained 17% of the variance in job satisfaction.Conclusion:This information can be used to guide facility wide programs and interventions aimed at increasing job satisfaction among all long-term care staff.",
