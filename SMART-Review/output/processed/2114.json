    "Abstract": "Background. Current health reports indicate an increased rate of mental illness among employees in social interaction professions. This reflects the high psychosocial demands in these fields of work. Against the background of the social significance of these professions, there are no comparative figures on the classification and significance of mental exhaustion among those in employment in these areas.Objectives. The study examines the psychological exhaustion among employees in the areas of care, early childhood education, schools, social work, and the police with other employees over time and in a gender comparison.Materials and methods. Mental exhaustion is statistically analyzed using an established index and univariate and bivariate analyzes. The BIBB/BAuA Employee Surveys-Work and Career in Transition, Acquisition and Exploitation of Professional Qualifications from 2006, 2012, and 2018 are used by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) and the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA).Results. Mental exhaustion is higher in all socially interactive occupations than in other workers. It is highest in the care professions, followed by educational staff, teaching staff, police, and social workers. In the majority of occupations, mental exhaustion increased in the survey period from 2006 to 2018.Discussion. The results show that the burden in personal service occupations has increased considerably in recent years. Measures to remedy the structural deficits and health-promoting measures are necessary to stabilize the health situation of the employees.",
