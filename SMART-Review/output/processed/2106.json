    "Abstract": "IntroductionPrevious international research indicates that people with severe mental illness often experience lower levels of activity participation and may therefore be marginalized from occupational opportunities that support recovery. This study aimed to describe activity and participation patterns of consumers of mental health services living in the community and identify significant relationships with demographic characteristics.MethodA cross-sectional observational study design was utilized, via data mining of the Activity and Participation Questionnaires completed while receiving services from an area mental health service. Data for 282 consumers, who submitted 333 questionnaires, were included.ResultsConsumers were mostly engaged in home-based and unpaid work, and their participation in these tasks significantly increased over time. Significant relationships were found between activity participation and age, gender and primary language. Consumers who were older were less likely to participate in employment, education and physical activity, while female and culturally and linguistically diverse consumers were less likely to engage in activities in the community.ConclusionDemographic factors may have a significant impact on the ability of consumers to participate in activities. This may require targeted approaches to activity and participation interventions for specific groups of consumers.",
