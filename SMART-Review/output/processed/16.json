    "Article Title": "Family Advocacy for the IPS Supported Employment Project: Accomplishments and Challenges",
    "Abstract": "Topic: A majority of people with serious mental illnesses want to return to work as part of their recovery, but access to effective employment services is limited. This report highlights the role that families can take to advocate for access to high-quality services for their relatives with mental illnesses. Purpose: This report summarizes major accomplishments of the family advocacy for the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment project, which is part of the Johnson & Johnson Dartmouth Community Mental Health Program. Sources Used: This description draws on published literature related to the role of families on behalf of individuals living with serious mental health conditions and supported employment services. The experiences of family members as advocates for change are also included. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Family teams can play a key role in changing public policy to increase access to evidence-based employment services and in promoting high-quality services at the local level in partnership with state mental health and vocational rehabilitation agency leaders responsible for employment services. In addition, family teams can educate their peers to better understand the role of work in recovery.",
