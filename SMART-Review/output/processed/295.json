    "Article Title": "Introducing Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment in Japan",
    "Abstract": "Individual Placement and Support is a standardized model of supported employment, developed initially for people with serious mental disorders and now applied to people with a range of disabilities. More than two dozen randomized controlled trials around the world show that the approach helps a majority of participants to succeed in competitive employment. Individual Placement and Support is spreading rapidly across the USA and in many other high-income countries, with facilitation by an international learning community.",
