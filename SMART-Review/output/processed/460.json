    "Abstract": "Background Pilot Peer Support Programs (PPSP) have been introduced in Europe as a measure to facilitate commercial pilots' mental health help-seeking in a confidential and non-punitive manner. However, research is scarce regarding what promotes and prevents pilots from approaching PPSP.Aims To investigate if, and in which way, different organizational and individual factors are associated with pilots' attitudes towards approaching PPSP, and to examine the prevalence of possible cases of depression and anxiety disorders among commercial pilots in Europe.Methods Data were collected using an anonymous web-based survey (n = 4494), covering pilots' work conditions, health and flight safety. Logistic regression was used to determine the impact of objective and psychosocial work environment factors, mental health factors, and demographic factors.Results Key findings were that just culture (odds ratio [OR] = 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97, 3.56), type of employment (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.46, 0.78), minimum guaranteed pay (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.48, 2.65), and symptoms of depression (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.50, 0.76) and anxiety (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.54, 0.80) significantly predicted pilots' attitude towards approaching PPSP. The prevalence of pilots scoring above threshold for possible depression (18%) and anxiety disorders (23%) were determined.Conclusions Pilot Peer Support in its current form appears to be an insufficient means to facilitate pilots' mental health help-seeking, but could have an important preventive purpose. The findings could assist authorities and operators in developing measures to facilitate pilots' help-seeking, and improve mental health and flight safety.Pilot Peer Support Programs (PPSP) are mandatory in Europe to facilitate pilots' mental health help-seeking. However, little is known about which factors promote and prevent pilots from approaching PPSP. A survey of European pilots shows that those reporting a just culture, support from colleagues and management, a fixed monthly salary and direct employment were more inclined to approach PPSP. Pilots with clinically relevant symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders were less inclined to approach PPSP.",
