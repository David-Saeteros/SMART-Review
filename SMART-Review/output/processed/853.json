    "Article Title": "Meeting the Developmental Needs of Young Adults Diagnosed with Serious Mental Health Challenges: the Emerge Model",
    "Abstract": "Adult providers struggle to engage 18-25-year olds despite high rates of serious mental health challenges observed among this age group. A new model, called Emerge, combines the intensive outreach and multidisciplinary team-based approach used in Assertive Community Treatment with Positive Youth Development principles and practices used in the Transition to Independence Process Model. Emerge bridges youth and adult services, focuses on supporting transition-to-adulthood milestone achievement, and is a sister team to Coordinated Specialty Care for recent psychosis onset. This paper describes Emerge components, practices, and findings from a feasibility pilot study using agency administrative data. Most prevalent goals were employment and social support/relationship related. The majority made progress on individual goals, engaged in employment and education, and experienced decreased psychiatric hospitalizations. Community mental health policy and practice implications are discussed, including funding blending of evidence-based practices for those transitioning to adulthood with youth-onset serious mental health conditions.",
