    "Article Title": "Interventions to reduce the risk of mental health problems in health and social care workplaces: A scoping review",
    "Abstract": "Work in the health and social care sector is stressful, and work-related stress increases the risk of depression, anxiety, burnout, and sleep disorders. Although interventions to reduce stress and burnout at workplaces have been developed and studied, most studies have lacked the effectiveness to improve the situation. Thus, more knowledge on interventions and analysis of their mechanisms is needed to reduce the risk of more adverse mental health problems (MHP). We conducted a scoping review to identify the relevant literature on individual and organizational interventions to improve mental health in health and social care workplaces. Data were gathered on target groups, intervention types and their effectiveness, and the outcomes of the interventions. We summarized this data thematically. The final review consisted of 76 studies. Mental health interventions primarily focused on health care workers rather than social care professionals. The interventions were mostly directed at individual workers, ignoring organizational-level interventions. They used a great variety of outcomes and questionnaires, and the questionnaires that measured the outcomes were used ambiguously. In most cases, the reported effectiveness of the studied interventions was incoherent, and many of the interventions had both statistically significant and non-significant effects. Evidence that interventions reduce the risk of work-related MHP is scarce. High-quality randomized controlled trials of interventions to promote mental health with more coherently formed outcomes are needed, especially on the organizational level. More interventions to improve social care professionals' mental health are also needed.",
