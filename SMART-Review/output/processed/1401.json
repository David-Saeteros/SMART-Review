    "Article Title": "A pilot randomized controlled trial on motivational interviewing in return to work after work disability",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Does 15-minute consult using Motivational Interviewing (MI) have a positive effect on (1) time until return to work (RTW) and relapse after work resumption for patients who have been work disabled for longer than 3 months, and (2) can psychological variables (i.e., work-related motivation, work-related psychological needs, quality of life and work ability) explain these results?Methods: 265 patients were included in a pilot randomized controlled trial, parallel and single blind, with an allocation ratio of 1:1 comparing the consult with MI with the consult as usual group (CAU). There was a 12 -month follow up on actual RTW and relapse for both groups. The psychological outcomes were work-related motivation (MAWS), work-related psychological needs (BPNSFS), quality of life (EQ5D5L)) and work ability (WAI). Measurement of these indicators took place at baseline, 1 week after the intervention and 3 months after the intervention.Results: Patients in the MI group showed faster RTW and had a lower chance of relapse compared to those in the CAU condition. No significant differences were found between MI and CAU for the psychological outcomes.Conclusions: Based on our results, there is some evidence that counseling including MI helps work-disabled pa-tients to RTW faster and experience less relapse. However, much remains unknown about the underlying psy-chological mechanisms explaining this effect. Suggestions are made for the full RCT.",
