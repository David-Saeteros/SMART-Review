    "Abstract": "Abstract: People with a diagnosis of severe mental disorder (SMD) have significantly higher unemployment rates than the general population. This is associated with a greater risk of social exclusion and marginalization, and favors the chronicity of personal and social difficulties. This observational study aims to assess the relationship between employment and subjective emotional state in people with a SMD diagnosis. The study included 744 participants (304 with a SMD diagnosis who were users of psychosocial rehabilitation resources, 168 with a SMD diagnosis with supported employment, and 272 people without diagnosis of SMD with ordinary (non-supported) employment), with a mean age of 41.9 years and 50.1% women. Out of the 744 participants, 577 (77.6%) had an employment (409 (60.9%) ordinary employment and 168 (29.1%) supported employment), 244 (32.8%) reported that they have a diagnosis of psychosis and 400 (53.8%) that they have a recognized disability. People with an employment had better subjective psychological well-being values than people without an employment (p=0.013), regardless of diagnosis or disability. There were no significant differences in subjective psychological well-being between people with ordinary employment and people with supported employment (p=0.687). In conclusion, people with a paid employment had higher subjective psychological well-being than people without an employment, regardless of diagnosis, disability or whether the employment was ordinary or supported.",
