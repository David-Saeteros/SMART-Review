    "Article Title": "Critical Components in Implementing Evidence-based Practice: A Multiple Case Study of Individual Placement and Support for People with Psychiatric Disabilities",
    "Abstract": "When developing Community Mental Health Services to support people with psychiatric disabilities, European countries are advocating evidence-based practice (EBP). Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based model designed to support people in acquiring and maintaining competitive employment. Implementation science is a growing research field, with a focus on components that impact the process of implementing EBP programmes. In this multiple case study, we have followed three IPS demonstration sites for two years, in order to describe and analyze barriers and facilitators for implementation, according to constructs described in the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Damschroder et al. 2009). The results highlight the importance of strategic networking, as well as the need for planning and preparations carried out before the start of an EBP programme, since deficiencies related to these constructs are difficult to compensate for.",
