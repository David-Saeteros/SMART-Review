    "Abstract": "A research project at an Australian regional university reframed disability by defining the diagnosis of a disability with an impact on learning as a learning challenge. Using the terminology of learning challenge, an anonymous, online survey found there was a significant number of students who chose institutional non-disclosure and excluded themselves from legally mandated support for learning. Using a sample of 111 students from this previously hidden group, qualitative analysis was performed on their stated reasons for non-disclosure using the conceptual lens of stigma mechanisms and theories at individual, situational, and institutional levels. This research found that internalised stigma is most common for students living with mental health issues (n=97), who anticipate discrimination and prejudice should disclosure be made. Further analysis for this group found students described stigma as having effected learning through poorer academic outcomes, reduced social support and academic help-seeking, and a perception that future professional identities excluded those living with mental health issues. Non-disclosure was perceived by students to be necessary to protect them from being discredited within their learning environment and, for some, in future employment. Structural elements of stigma, such as the qualification of disability and process of disclosure, were seen to be barriers. Perceived discrimination and the desire to protect students' ideal identity (not disabled) were also described. Institutions may find these results useful to develop changes that will result in improved academic outcomes, retention, and completion for students living with disability and stigma.",
