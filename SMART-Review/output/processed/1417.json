    "Article Title": "Prevalence and associated factors of depression symptoms in fathers of children aged 6 months to 17 years in Quebec",
    "Abstract": "Objectives: In fathers, depression symptoms experienced during pregnancy and after childbirth represent a depression risk factor during the child first months. Since depression can have a huge impact on their subsequent involvement with the child, this issue is worrisome and requires consideration. Until now, however, few studies have dealt with paternal depression and its determinants beyond the perinatal period. Method: This study uses data from a representative provincial survey conducted with 1342 fathers of children aged 6 months to 17 years. It documents the prevalence of moderate and severe depression symptoms with the CES-D scale as well as associated factors. Results: Findings show prevalence rates ranging from 3% to 10% depending on depression symptom severity and children age. Associated factors include problematic use of alcohol, no employment, stress related to balancing work and family, domestic violence environment, and low revenue and social support. Conclusion: These results are interpreted in light of the role and involvement fathers keep in their child's life. They also stress the importance of identifying depression symptoms in this population beyond the perinatal period while monitoring the symptom intensity.",
