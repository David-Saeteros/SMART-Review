    "Abstract": "Purpose of Review Emotion artificial intelligence (AI) is technology for emotion detection and recognition. Emotion AI is expanding rapidly in commercial and government settings outside of medicine, and will increasingly become a routine part of daily life. The goal of this narrative review is to increase awareness both of the widespread use of emotion AI, and of the concerns with commercial use of emotion AI in relation to people with mental illness. Recent Findings This paper discusses emotion AI fundamentals, a general overview of commercial emotion AI outside of medicine, and examples of the use of emotion AI in employee hiring and workplace monitoring. The successful re-integration of patients with mental illness into society must recognize the increasing commercial use of emotion AI. There are concerns that commercial use of emotion AI will increase stigma and discrimination, and have negative consequences in daily life for people with mental illness. Commercial emotion AI algorithm predictions about mental illness should not be treated as medical fact.",
