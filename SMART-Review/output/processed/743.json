    "Article Title": "Work Ability Impairment and Facets of Workplace Perception Are Predictive of Sick Leave Duration in Persons With Work Anxiety",
    "Abstract": "Individuals with work anxiety are at risk for long-term sick leave and create high costs for society, companies, and their own work biography. Understanding psychological return-to-work predictors is important for early reintegration of these persons into the work context. This longitudinal study for the first time investigates the predictive value of workplace perception and objective work ability impairment for future sick leave duration in persons with work anxiety. The investigation was carried out with 103 individuals with work anxieties. They were of working age and confronted with a return-to-work situation after somatic illness. Work ability impairment was assessed in a structured interview by a state-licensed sociomedical specialist using the established Mini-ICF-APP Scale. Participants completed a questionnaire on their workplace perception (KFZA). The degree of work ability impairment (Mini-ICF-APP) was predictive of longer sick leave as well as workplace perception (KFZA dimensions scope of action, social support, need for cooperation). Training and return-to-work support in persons with work anxiety should focus on both work ability impairment and on workplace perception.",
