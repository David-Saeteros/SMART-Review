    "Abstract": "Goal:Employee assistance programs (EAPs) have been evolving since they first became prevalent in the 1970s. The important counseling component of EAPs is sometimes lost in discussions about what they do, with many EAPs marketing a broad portfolio of services such as childcare, elder care, legal referral, and other concierge services rather than counseling. The objective of this study was to examine outcomes for the EAP of one organization (Mayo Clinic), compare them to outcomes reported in the literature, and gain insights to help all healthcare organizations best support their employees.Methods:Consistent with customary EAP practice, data for this study was collected through an anonymous survey link distributed by e-mail to users of individual counseling as well as users of organizational consulting services such as advising leaders and supervisors and leading educational sessions.Principal Findings:All (n = 82) individual counseling respondents indicated they would recommend the EAP, none reported worse symptoms, 90% decreased their stress levels, 92% reduced their feelings of anxiety, 88% enjoyed an overall improvement in mood, and 95% developed new skills. If their concern was work-related, 96% agreed the counselor understood the work culture and was able to provide helpful guidance; of the clients who were feeling burned out, 86% agreed they gained strategies to reduce its symptoms. Thematic analysis of individual counseling services indicated that participants highly valued their counselors. Regarding organizational consulting services, respondents (n = 50) indicated EAP services increased their confidence as leaders, supported their work, and provided tangible guidance. They appreciated having an internal EAP counselor. Thematic analysis of organizational consulting services indicated that EAP supported leaders by listening, coaching, and empowering them to normalize issues.Practical Applications:EAPs have evolved into distinct internal, external, and hybrid internal-external models. Internal model counselors are company employees with inside knowledge of company culture, external EAP model counselors are contracted outside of the company, and hybrid models combine a small cadre of internal counselors with the support of outside contractors. Regardless of the model, EAP counselors must collaborate with internal stakeholders, notably the human resources department, to efficiently identify and troubleshoot employee relational issues and allow for customized initiatives to improve mental health. Based upon these findings and the authors' direct experiences with EAP providers, components of an ideal EAP are outlined to show how EAPs can best support employees. Healthcare leaders seeking to add EAP services are advised to focus on offerings that are custom fit to the organization.",
