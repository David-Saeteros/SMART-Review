    "Abstract": "Introduction: There is a worrying upward trend in alcohol consumption by women during the middle of life stages. Alcohol consumption can have negative health consequences, some of which women are particularly susceptible. To address this alarming trend, it is necessary to understand the antecedents of alcohol consumption among women. The purpose of this longitudinal study is to examine the predictors of alcohol consumption between 2009 and 2018, in a sample of women in their 40s at the final time point. Methods: Data were drawn from four waves of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health over 9 years at four time points (2009-2018; N = 6900). Women were between 31 and 36 years old in 2009 and between 40 and 45 years old in 2018. Results: There was a 3% increase in the proportion of women drinking at risk levels between 2009 and 2018. A multinominal logistic mixed effects model found that, after adjusting for covariates, depression (relative risk ratio [RR] = 1.04, p<0.001), high social support (RR = 1.17, p<0.001) and employment relative to not working (RR = 2.32, p<0.001), working in management compared to a professional role (RR = 1.51, p<0.001) and no dependent child at home (RR = 0.80 [0.07], p = 0.017) were predictors of risky drinking compared to not drinking. Discussion: These findings underscore the importance of peer influence, mental health and stress associated with managing multiple responsibilities as key factors to address in targeting high-risk drinking behaviors among women. There is a clear need for more opportunities for women to assess their relationships with alcohol and seek help in the process. Addressing this issue is paramount, especially considering its increasing prevalence.",
