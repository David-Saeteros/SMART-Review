    "Article Title": "Non-Migrant Paid Domestic Workers and Depressive Symptoms: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review",
    "Abstract": "Health of non-migrant paid domestic workers (PDWs) has seldom been studied. This review examines the relationship between being a non-migrant paid domestic worker and manifesting depressive symptoms (DS). Following a mixed-methods systematic review protocol, we found 10 relevant cross-sectional studies conducted in African, Asian, and Latin American countries. Depressive symptoms prevalence reported in quantitative studies ranged from 28% (CI: 22-35) to 53% (CI: 46-60). Qualitative evidence points towards structural conditions (poverty and intersectional discrimination) as drivers of female job placement in domestic work. Qualitative and quantitative evidence suggest that DS occurs more frequently in PDWs than other workers in the informal labor market. Psychosocial risks, working conditions, and workplace abuse play an intervening role in the development of DS. Future longitudinal research and adequate sampling methods are needed to examine protective factors, perceptions of working conditions, and work-family conflict in PDWs to better assess the development of DS among them.",
