    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are a major cause for new disability grants in Norway. A variety of approaches in vocational rehabilitation is needed for this group. Green work is one such program that has been implemented at Norwegian care farms, which aims to promote health and support the transition from unemployment to working life.OBJECTIVE: To describe care farms in Norway and identify the presence of key components of such vocational programs.METHODS: In this case study, we used The Norwegian National Register of Care Farms to gain an overview of farms with vocational rehabilitation programs. Data consisted of written information from five farms' own web-site together with answers from a cross sectional questionnaire. Content about programs was systematically extracted by using national green work guidelines.RESULTS: Descriptions of care farm programs showed that key components outlined by the national guidelines for green work were present. These components were; (1) variety of work activities, (2) adaptation of work tasks, (3) the farmers' support and supervision, (4) experiencing nature, (5) enhanced structure in everyday life.CONCLUSION: The description of vocational programs on care farms in relation to these key components, gives a thorough understanding of the content and organization of such programs.",
