    "Abstract": "ObjectivesWe aimed to investigate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of a modified Individual Placement and Support intervention for people with mood and anxiety disorders (IPS-MA).MethodsCosts were assessed from a societal perspective. Health care costs were derived from registers and combined with data on use of IPS-MA services, municipal social care, and labour market services. EQ-5D was used to compute QALY. Missing data were imputed in a sensitivity analysis. We also computed the cost per gain in hours worked. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were computed and bootstrapped to obtain confidence intervals for QALY and gain in hours worked.ResultsWe found no difference in overall costs between groups. A significant saving was found in use of labour market services in the IPS-MA group. But the IPS-MA group had significantly lower wage earnings compared to the control group. The intervention group had a higher, though statistically in-significant, increase in QALYs than the control group. The ICER did not show statistically significant results, but there was a tendency, that IPS-MA could have a positive effect on health-related quality of life without any additional costs. However, participants in the IPS-MA group had a significantly lower gain in hours worked compared to the control group.ConclusionsDespite a significant saving in use of labour market services, IPS-MA was not cost-effective. Participants in the IPS-MA group worked significantly fewer hours and earned significantly less than participants in the control group at 1-year follow-up.",
