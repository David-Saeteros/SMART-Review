    "Article Title": "Examining Alcohol Interventions Across the Lifespan among the African Diaspora: A Systematic Review",
    "Abstract": "Aims: Racial/ethnic and cultural identity influences alcohol use consumption and help-seeking behaviors. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess alcohol prevention programs and interventions targeting African Americans/Blacks among the African Diaspora across the lifespan.Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines, literature searches were conducted via electronic databases, grey literature, and hand searches of relevant journal articles evaluating primary outcome data to reduce alcohol use. To be included in this systematic review, intervention and prevention studies required a population of more than 50% African descent and provided information about statistical significance ( p < .05) indicating changes in alcohol as a primary outcome.Results: Search strategy identified 5691 citations and the full-text of 148 studies were screened. A total of 23 articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies were geographically located in the United States and African countries. Interventions were implemented in community, patient-care, school, and workplace settings. Adult studies evaluated pharmacological and/or behavioral interventions while utilizing validated instruments and procedures to assess alcohol outcomes. Strategies to change alcohol behavior included psychotherapy, brief motivational interviewing (BMI), and counseling. Adolescent studies utilized family-based, computer-assisted technology, and career development interventions to reduce alcohol use.Conclusions: The systematic review identified a range of intervention articles addressing the reduction of alcohol use for African Americans/Blacks that may be used in various settings and by different age groups. Best practices and strategies designed to address socio-cultural factors by promoting protective and risk-reducing factors of alcohol use and successful alcohol interventions are needed.",
