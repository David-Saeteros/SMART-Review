    "Abstract": "Objective: This study evaluates the effects of time incarcerated on employment outcomes between a manualized vocational program, the About Face Vocational Program (AFVP), and a hybrid program of the AFVP and Individualized Placement and Support, Supported Employment (AFVP + IPS-SE). Method: Eighty-four veterans with the histories of felony convictions and a mental illness or a substance use disorder were randomly assigned to the AFVP or AFVP + IPS-SE conditions and followed for 6 months. The associations between time to employment and months incarcerated were evaluated using nonparametric tests. Findings: The number of months incarcerated was positively associated with time to employment in the hybrid AFVP + IPS-SE condition but not the AFVP condition. In addition, significant differences were found between employment rates of the groups at lower number of months incarcerated, with higher rates of employment in the hybrid AFVP + IPS-SE condition, becoming similar as months incarcerated increased. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: Number of months incarcerated may have a deleterious effect on employment rates when using IPS-SE.",
