    "Abstract": "The effects of mental diseases on the employment and working situation can be substantial. They are one of the main reasons for inability to work and reduced earning capacity. Against this background the question arises about suitable occupational reintegration measures for people with severe mental illnesses. In recent years, the principle of supported employment has been internationally shown to be increasingly more successful. In this context mentally ill people are primarily placed at a position of the first employment market and supported on-site by a job coach. This concept is inclusive, individual and evidence based. Despite proven effectiveness, it has so far been insufficiently implemented in German-speaking regions. In the future it will be a matter of considering the individual needs for assistance of mentally ill people more intensively than previously and to respond with functional and in a best-case scenario, multiprofessional and flexible offers.",
