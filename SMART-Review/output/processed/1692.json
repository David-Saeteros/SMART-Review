    "Article Title": "Occupational engagement and cognitive functioning among persons with schizophrenia: an explorative study",
    "Abstract": "Background: Cognitive functioning may have implications for engagement in daily occupations among people with schizophrenia.Objectives: This cross-sectional study explores relationships between time use assessed occupational engagement and cognitive functioning among persons with schizophrenia.Methods: Thirty-nine participants from four mental health care services in Sweden participated. The Profile of Occupational Engagement among persons with Severe mental illness (POES) and a cognitive test battery was used.Results: Higher attention and psychomotor speed and higher scores in information processing speed, immediate and delayed verbal recall, and immediate and delayed visual recall were significantly correlated with higher scores in occupational engagement. Regression analyzes revealed that information processing speed and delayed visual recall best explained the variance in occupational engagement (R-2 = 0.36).Conclusions: Cognitive functioning has implications for occupational engagement, and thus the ability to perform daily occupations in a balanced rhythm within various social and physical environments.",
