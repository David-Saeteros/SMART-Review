    "Article Title": "Contents and Intensity of Services in Low- and High-Fidelity Programs for Supported Employment: Results of a Longitudinal Survey",
    "Abstract": "Objective: Little is known about the association between service intensity and fidelity scale score in supported employment programs. This study compares service contents and intensity in low- and high-fidelity programs and examines the validity of the Japanese version of the individualized Supported Employment Fidelity Scale.Methods: The vocational outcomes and service provision data for 51 individuals with schizophrenia in 13 supported employment programs were collected over a 12-month study period. Outcomes, service contents, and service intensity were compared between the low-fidelity group (seven programs; N=29) and the high-fidelity group (six programs; N=22).Results: In both groups, 70% of the total services (hours) were provided in the first 6 months. The high-fidelity group, which was associated with better vocational outcomes than the low-fidelity group (employment rate, 68% versus 38%, respectively), made the greatest effort in job development outside of the agency, whereas the low-fidelity group spent more time on group services. In addition, before the client obtained a job, high-fidelity programs provided outreach services (B=7.2, p=0.043) and agency-based individual services (B=5.7, p<0.001) at greater intensity than did low-fidelity programs. However, no significant between-group difference was found in service intensity once clients were employed.Conclusions: Supported employment programs with a high fidelity score focus more intensely on providing individual services in and outside of the agency, particularly before clients obtain a job. However, clarification of the relationships among service quality at the structure level, amount of follow-up services, and individual needs in supported employment programs is a future issue.",
