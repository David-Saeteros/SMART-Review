    "Article Title": "A qualitative study of the service experiences of women with autism spectrum disorder",
    "Abstract": "It is recognized that the experiences of women with autism spectrum disorder are often underrepresented in the literature. In this study, 20 women with autism spectrum disorder participated in five focus groups with discussions centered on their service use, unmet service needs, and barriers to care. Overall, women emphasized high unmet service needs, particularly with respect to mental health concerns, residential supports, and vocational and employment services. Participants also perceived many service providers as disregarding or misunderstanding women's service needs. Findings of the current exploratory study are discussed in relation to areas of future research required to ensure effective care for this understudied population.",
