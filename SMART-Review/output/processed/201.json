    "Abstract": "Goal of the Study: In Germany, mental disorders have increasing importance for disability and early retirement. However, patients may have to wait several months before becoming an appointment with a psycho(somatic) therapist. Accordingly, several companies initiated a psychosomatic consultation in the workplace (PCIW). This concept has been explored.Methods: Qualitative data analysis (expert interviews with stakeholders, focus group interviews with occupational health physicians; Mayring's content analysis) focussed on the question of how the concept of a PCIW can be tailored to meet the employees' needs.Results: Concepts and implementation of PCIW differed with regard to the aspects dissemination of information about the consultation, gatekeeping, place of the consultation, and number of appointments with the psycho(somatic) therapist. The concepts of PCIW may be described as more or less restrictive or liberal. The interviewees emphasised the need for PCIW and discussed the involvement of the occupational health physician within this approach. PCIW proved of value. Yet, the interviewees were ambivalent regarding the fact that companies offer and pay for treatment which should be provided within standard health care.Conclusion: Shaping company-based elements of standard health care should respect setting-specific needs and involve in-company stakeholders into the process.",
