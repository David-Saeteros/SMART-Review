    "Article Title": "The association between social stressors and drug use/hazardous drinking among former prison inmates",
    "Abstract": "Social stressors are associated with relapse to substance use among people receiving addiction treatment and people with substance use risk behaviors. The relationship between social stressors and drug use/hazardous drinking in former prisoners has not been studied. We interviewed former prisoners at baseline, 1 to 3 weeks post prison release, and follow up, between 2 and 9 months following the baseline interview. Social stressors were characterized by unemployment, homelessness, unstable housing, problems with family, friends, and/or significant others, being single, or major symptoms of depression. Associations between baseline social stressors and follow-up drug use and hazardous drinking were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Problems with family, friends, and/or significant others were associated with reported drug use (AOR 3.01, 95% CI 1.18-7.67) and hazardous drinking (AOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.05-6.87) post release. Further research may determine whether interventions and policies targeting social stressors can reduce relapse among former inmates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
