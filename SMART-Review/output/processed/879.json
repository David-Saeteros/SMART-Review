    "Abstract": "Peer-delivered services for individuals with psychiatric conditions are becoming an established part of the mental health workforce. Given the growing focus on evidence-based supported employment, peer specialists are often assisting individuals who are choosing, getting, or keeping employment. As part of a larger randomized clinical trial examining the effectiveness of an innovative intervention called vocational peer support, 13 semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted to examine how recipients perceived peer support, and whether or how it was useful for pursuing vocational goals. A thematic analysis approach was utilized for identifying major themes and sub-themes. Results suggest that a key factor in the effectiveness of vocational peer support is the identification with another individual's lived experience, which then promotes engagement and a sense of normalcy. Vocational peer support may be particularly useful for individuals with psychiatric disabilities wishing to pursue a vocational goal.",
