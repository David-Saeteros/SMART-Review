    "Article Title": "Trends and Impact Factors of Mental Health Service Utilization among Resettled Humanitarian Migrants in Australia: Findings from the BNLA Cohort Study",
    "Abstract": "Resettled humanitarian migrants (HMs) have high levels of mental disorders, but factors associated with the utilization of mental health services (MHS) are poorly understood. We aimed to explore trends and impact factors of MHS utilization among HMs in the process of resettlement in Australia. A total of 2311 HMs from the 1st (2013), 3rd, and 5th (2018) waves of a national cohort study were included. MHS utilization in the past year was assessed by two indicators: having MHS contacts and the frequency of MHS contacts. Trends were identified by Cochran-Armitage tests, and generalized linear mixed models and ordered logistic models were fitted to explore impact factors of MHS utilization. The proportion of having MHS contacts significantly rose from 13.0% to 29.4% over the five years. MHS utilization was mainly driven by perceived needs, such as post-traumatic stress disorders and the degree of post-migration stress. Unemployment and strong belongingness to the local community were also associated with having MHS contacts. No significant gender difference was found in having MHS contacts but females tended to contact MHS more frequently. Resettled HMs have a persistent dilemma of high mental illness prevalence and MHS underutilization. Sustainable mental health education and long-term resettlement services targeted at social integration that consider gender difference are urgently needed in host countries.",
