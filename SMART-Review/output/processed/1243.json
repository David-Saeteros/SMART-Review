    "Article Title": "The role of career counselling in improving the psychological and economic wellbeing of single mothers",
    "Abstract": "Since the late twentieth century, there has been an increase in the number of families headed by a single female parent. Single mothers face a myriad of psychological, social, financial, and institutional challenges that impact wellbeing and career development. Career counselling efforts can provide support for single mothers' career development. In this effort, building better careers may ultimately help single mothers cope more effectively with challenges by diminishing financial strain and psychological distress while bolstering resources. The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical overview of conditions that impact the career development of single mothers and to offer relevant counselling models and intervention strategies. Counselling strategies to improve single mothers' self-efficacy and self-concept, address role conflict and overload, and advocate for single mothers are discussed using social cognitive career theory and Super's life-span, life space theory as models for support.",
