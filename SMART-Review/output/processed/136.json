    "Article Title": "Evaluation of an Employment Intervention for Veterans Transitioning From the Military A Randomized Controlled Trial",
    "Abstract": "Military personnel face numerous challenges transitioning from military jobs to meaningful civilian employment. The Independence Project compared an innovative employment program (National Career Coach Program) with standard employment services (Local Community Resources) in a randomized controlled trial. Study participants were transitioning veterans with self-reported service-connected disabilities seeking permanent employment. The primary outcomes were paid employment and disability ratings over 1 year. Secondary outcomes included health and well-being. At 1-year follow-up, National Career Coach Program participants were significantly more likely to work, had significantly greater earnings, and reported significantly greater improvements in physical and mental health compared with participants assigned to Local Community Resources. Both groups increased in disability ratings over 12 months, with no difference between groups. Multifaceted supports delivered by the National Career Coach Program increased employment, earnings, mental health, and physical health over 1 year. These significant differences appeared even though control group participants achieved considerable employment success.",
