    "Abstract": "Objective: To describe key features and the initial implementation of an employer-sponsored program designed to increase access to quality mental health treatment for employees of a large health care system. Methods: Retrospective data were collected on employer's efforts to develop a programmatic solution to address barriers to accessing quality mental health treatment among its employees and on initial program implementation. Results: Data from the initial cohort (N = 1049) of program participants support the use of low threshold digital tools to enhance access to care, the importance of care navigation and a robust curated provider network in matching employees to appropriate care options, and the value of providing online, evidence-based psychotherapy to facilitate high rates of treatment engagement. Conclusions: Findings can help inform employers about approaches to improve access to quality mental health treatment for their employees.",
