    "Article Title": "Mentalizing as Mechanism: An Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis of Workplace Social Support in Intimate Partner Violence Practice",
    "Abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) social workers are at elevated risk of developing post-traumatic stress resulting from ongoing exposure to potentially distressing client disclosures. Workplace social support (WSS) may play a role in moderating that risk. This study used the interpretive phenomenological analysis approach to gain understanding about the phenomenon of WSS from the perspective of IPV social workers. Perceptions of having received WSS, or that WSS was available, were formed by worker's specific needs being met and by their having access to support people with disciplinary skills. The theory of mentalization is advanced here as a framework from which to understand the processes leading to IPV social worker perceptions of WSS. Implications for social work practice and further research are presented.",
