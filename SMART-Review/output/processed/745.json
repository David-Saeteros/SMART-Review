    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Previous scholarship has posited that veterinarians experience more anxiety, depression, and compassion fatigue symptoms than the general population. Disclosure of psychological stressors, combined with positive responsive-ness, may reduce psychological symptoms. The goal of this study was to test the relationships between disclosure, responsiveness, compassion fatigue, anxiety, and depression.SAMPLE 230 veterinarians from a private Facebook online support group.PROCEDURES Veterinarians from a private Facebook online support group were administered a cross-sectional survey using estab-lished scales measuring disclosure, responsiveness, compassion fatigue, anxiety, and depression. All scales reported strong reliability and validity.RESULTS Pearson correlations and mediation models were used to analyze the data. A small, negative, direct relationship between disclosure and depression was found, yet the more interesting results were that responsiveness had a significant, indirect effect on the relationship between disclosure and compassion fatigue, anxiety, and depression.CLINICAL RELEVANCE Disclosure may be related to decreased experiences of compassion fatigue, anxiety, and depression when respon-siveness is also present. Veterinarians may benefit from improved mental well-being knowing that there are op- portunities to disclose concerns to peers. Additionally, fellow veterinarians can benefit from understanding how to respond to disclosures in a positive, nonstigmatizing manner.",
