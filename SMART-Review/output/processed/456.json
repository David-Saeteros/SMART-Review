    "Article Title": "Coordinating Mental Health Services for People with Serious Mental Illness: A Scoping Review of Transitions from Psychiatric Hospital to Community",
    "Abstract": "Effective coordination as people with serious mental illness (SMI) move between care settings is essential. We aimed to review challenges to care coordination for people with SMI and identify approaches for improving it. Sixteen articles were identified. Two main challenges emerged: people with SMI facing adjustment challenges during transitions and services struggling to provide continuity of care. Effective approaches addressed coordination challenges and resulted in better improvements in service utilization, social functioning and quality of life. Future interventions may benefit from shared decision-making, support for caregivers, and addressing the challenges associated with complicated medication regimes and accessing medications.",
