    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE To describe burden transfer in a sample of veterinary workers employed by a Canadian veterinary corporation and to examine the association between different levels of burden transfer and employee burnout and perceived psychosocial work environment. SAMPLE 475 employees of small -animal veterinary hospitals owned by a corporate practice group. METHODS Veterinary team members among 14 working groups responded to an online survey that included assessments of burden transfer, psychosocial environment, and burnout within the workplace. Participants were divided into groups on the basis of self -reported burden -transfer scores being low, mid, or high, and multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted to ascertain associations between level of burden transfer, psychosocial environment, and burnout. RESULTS On average, participants perceived difficult encounters with clients to occur with moderate frequency and reported reactions that were low -moderate in intensity. Individuals with high burden -transfer scores were identified in all working groups. Across the 3 burden -transfer groups, the key finding was that high-level burden transfer was associated with perception of greater emotional demands within the workplace, reduced support from supervisors, reduced feeling of social community in the workplace, and elevated rates of burnout among these participants. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings highlight elevated risks for a certain population of veterinary employees experiencing high levels of burden transfer and underscore the potential need for targeted interventions to support these individuals. Employees who currently react to challenging client interactions with moderate or low intensity may also benefit from these programs as a preventative measure.",
