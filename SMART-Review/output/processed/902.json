    "Abstract": "Objective Many people with serious mental illness (SMI) continue to struggle with work functioning despite the receipt of supported employment (SE) services. In response, adjunctive interventions to SE have begun to be developed. One such approach, the cognitive behavioral therapy for work success (CBTw) intervention, targets cognitive and behavioral barriers to competitive work success in adults with SMI. Using a pre-post design, this pilot study examined the psychosocial outcomes of the CBTw program in 52 adults with SMI receiving SE. Method Recovery attitudes, work-related self-efficacy, self-esteem, and symptom domains (depression, anxiety, psychosis) were measured at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Paired samplest-tests examined changes in outcomes over time. Results At posttreatment, participants had significant improvements in recovery attitudes, self-esteem, depressive, and negative symptoms. Other psychosocial outcomes did not significantly change. Conclusions This pilot work demonstrates CBTw is a promising intervention to improve recovery and wellness in SMI.",
