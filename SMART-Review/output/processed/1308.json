    "Article Title": "Psychosocial Working Conditions and Sickness Absence in a General Population A Cohort Study of 21,834 Workers in Norway (The HUNT Study)",
    "Abstract": "Objective: To examine the associations between psychosocial working conditions and sickness absence. Methods: Data for 21,834 employed adults from the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) were linked to the sickness benefit register and sickness absence during 1 year after survey participation was analyzed with logistic regression. Results: A one unit change on a 0 to 3 self-reported job demand scale was associated with a fully adjusted 24% and 25% increased odds of sickness absence in men and women, respectively. A one unit change on a 0 to 3 scale for self-reported support at work was associated with a fully adjusted 13% and 17% reduced odds of sickness absence in men and women, respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that demands, and to some extent support, at work might influence sickness absence-also when adjusting for a detailed categorization of occupations.",
