    "Article Title": "Attitude Toward and Associating Factors of Menopause: A Study on Cambodian Women",
    "Abstract": "This study aimed to assess the attitudes of Cambodian women toward menopause and its associating factors. A cross-sectional study design was used to examine the attitudes of 181 Cambodian women ages 40-60 years toward menopause using the Attitude toward Menopause (ATM) scale. The mean total attitude score was determined as 84.54 +/- 1 1.55 on a scale of 35-140, indicating that most participants had negative attitudes toward menopause. Perimenopausal women had more negative attitudes (80.02 +/- 9.19) while postmenopausal women had more positive attitudes (86.63 +/- 12.07) and was statistically significant (p = .006). Perimenopausal women perceived menopause as a health concerning medical issue requiring treatment, and something unpleasant in their lives. Older age and employment were the independent factors associated with positive attitudes to menopause. Tailored menopausal interventions and counseling for women in perimenopause, and younger and unemployed women regarding the symptoms of menopause should be considered as crucial for midlife Cambodian women.",
