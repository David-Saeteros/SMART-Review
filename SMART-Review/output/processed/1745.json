    "Abstract": "BackgroundThere are well-documented racial/ethnic inequities in drug-related overdoses and access to evidence-based opioid use services nationally and in Boston, MA.ObjectiveTo qualitatively explore the drivers of racial/ethnic inequities in access to opioid use disorder treatment and services in Boston.DesignSemi-structured qualitative interviews.ParticipantsUsing purposive sampling, researchers recruited 59 opioid overdose survivors in Boston who self-identified as Black, Hispanic or Latino/a/x, and/or White.ApproachInterviewers administered a socio-demographic and drug use survey, and used a semi-structured interview guide to explore experiences with and perspectives on substance use treatment and services.Key ResultsParticipants' racial/ethnic identities were distributed across three subgroups: non-Hispanic Black (n = 18; 31%), non-Hispanic White (n = 18; 31%), and Latino/a/x (n = 23; 39%). Qualitative analysis identified multiple themes that were organized into four social-ecological levels after analysis. At the individual level, some participants emphasized the importance of personal responsibility and individual motivation in determining access to services. Participants expressed a range of perspectives about using medication for opioid use disorder treatment; Black and Latino/a/x participants were more likely than White participants to have critical perspectives. At the interpersonal level, experiences of bias, stigma, and racism from staff in healthcare and treatment settings were common. At the program/process level, participants described challenges connecting to services following overdose and barriers within specific programs, with Black and Latino/a/x participants experiencing particular gaps. At the systems level, the limited availability of housing, employment, and mental health care negatively impacted treatment access and engagement.ConclusionA racism lens was used during data interpretation to apply the themes at a broader population level. Through this lens, the identified barriers can be understood to have a disproportionate impact on people of color. Findings call for programmatic and policy solutions that address racism, break down stigma, and ensure equitable access to evidence-based services and social supports.",
