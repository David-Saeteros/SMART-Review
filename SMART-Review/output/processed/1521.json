    "Abstract": "Parents of Autistic children often modify their participation in leisure, social, and employment activities to meet the caregiving needs of their child. However, few studies have examined the impact this has on caregiver quality of life (QoL). The aim in the current study was to examine the role of participation in a range of activities on QoL amongst primary and secondary caregivers of school-aged Autistic children. Eighty-eight primary (93% mothers) and 63 secondary (91% fathers) caregivers of Autistic children (aged 7- to 12-years) participated in this cross-sectional study, with time pressure, participation, social support, parenting stress, and QoL measured via an online questionnaire. Compared to secondary caregivers, primary caregivers reported fewer employment hours, increased time pressure, less participation in desired activities, and higher perceived responsibility of domestic and child-rearing tasks. Similar levels of leisure frequency, parenting stress, and QoL were identified by both caregivers. Hierarchical regression revealed caregiver participation as important for QoL in both primary and secondary caregivers. However, when measures of caregiver well-being were added to the model, the unique contribution of participation to QoL was reduced, particularly for secondary caregivers. Overall, the findings demonstrate that despite differences in caregiver roles and responsibilities, participation in meaningful activities was important for QoL in all caregivers.The present study examined participation and well-being outcomes in primary and secondary caregivers, providing evidence for the different caregiver roles and responsibilities within families of Autistic children. While primary and secondary caregiver responsibilities were different, the findings showed that access to meaningful activities was important for quality of life amongst both primary and secondary caregivers.",
