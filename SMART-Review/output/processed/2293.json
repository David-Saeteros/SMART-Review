    "Article Title": "Prevalence and predictors of low future expectations among Syrian refugees resettled in Sweden",
    "Abstract": "Background: Future Expectation is important for motivation and wellbeing, however drastic life events such as in refugee situations may result in low expectations. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and determinants of low future expectations among Syrian refugees resettled in Sweden.Methods: A random sample of 1215 Syrian refugees resettled in Sweden responded to questionnaire. Weighted analyses and adjusted relative risks were conducted to determine the prevalences and predictors of low future expectations. Synergy index was calculated for low social support and depression in relation to low expectations.Results: The prevalences of low future expectations for labour market, social and economic intergration were 10.9%, 13.4% and 14.1% respectively. Longer stay in Sweden, being older, low social support and depression were associated with low future expectations. The simultaneous presence of depression and low social support had a synergistic effect on low social expectation.Discussions: Understanding and addressing factors related to low future expectations among refugees may be useful for facilitating their labour market, social and economic integration.",
