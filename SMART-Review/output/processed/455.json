    "Article Title": "The perceived impact of homelessness on health during pregnancy and the postpartum period: A qualitative study carried out in the metropolitan area of Nantes, France",
    "Abstract": "The number of homeless people has been constantly increasing in Europe over recent years, as well as the proportion of women among the homeless population. Pregnancy can increase the risk of becoming homeless and, on the other hand, homelessness has been widely connected to adverse perinatal outcomes. The objective of this study was to describe the overall perceived impact of homelessness on health during pregnancy and the postpartum period, using a qualitative research approach to prioritize women's perspective. One-time semi structured interviews were conducted with 10 pregnant women and 10 women in the postpartum period experiencing homelessness in the metropolitan area of Nantes, as well as with six people from their social surroundings. A thematic analysis was performed to identify major themes and sub-themes. Homelessness was perceived as having an overall negative impact on all aspects of health (physical health, mental health, and social well-being) during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Stress and anxiety, food insecurity, social isolation, physical suffering, deterioration of chronic diseases, and pregnancy complications, were the main perceived consequences of homelessness on health. On the other hand, social support, and the welcomeness of healthcare professionals during pregnancy and the postpartum period were identified as capable of palliating those consequences. Finally, basic needs, such as having access to suitable housing, being independent, and being in good health, were identified by participants in the study as their main priorities. The results of this study, as well as those found by previous research, allowed us to identify possible axes in tackling homelessness and its complex consequences on health during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Housing and income assistance interventions, promoting social support and employment, outreach services enhancing collaborative networks among healthcare service providers, and integrating coordinated multidisciplinary approaches in primary care have shown to provide promising solutions to this issue.",
