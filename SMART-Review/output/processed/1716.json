    "Article Title": "Examining bidirectional associations between perceived social support and psychological symptoms in the context of stressful event exposure: a prospective, longitudinal study",
    "Abstract": "Background After stressful event exposure, higher perceived social support is a well-established correlate of decreased risk for psychological symptoms, including depressive, anxiety and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, longitudinal data on the direction of this association and the stability of perceived social support are scarce and have yielded mixed results, with a particular lack of prospective studies. We aimed to investigate changes in perceived social support and bidirectional associations between perceived social support and psychological symptoms in a prospective, longitudinal study. Methods A sample of German soldiers was assessed before and after deployment to Afghanistan. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to investigate the stability of perceived social support and to identify possible distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Bidirectional associations between perceived social support (general and workplace) and psychological symptoms (depressive, anxiety and PTS) were examined using gamma regressions. Results Average levels of perceived general social support did not change, while perceived workplace social support increased slightly (t(344) = 5.51, p < .001). There were no distinguishable trajectories of perceived social support. Higher perceived general (Mean ratio (MR) = 0.84, 95% CI = [0.74, 0.95]) and workplace social support (MR = 0.82, 95% CI = [0.72, 0.92]) predicted lower depressive symptoms, but not anxiety or PTS symptoms. Only higher PTS (MR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.91, 0.99]) and higher depressive symptoms (MR = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.93, 0.99]) predicted lower perceived general social support. Conclusions Perceived social support can remain relatively stable under exposure to environmental stressors such as military deployment. Higher perceived social support could protect against depressive symptoms via a stress-buffering mechanism, while support may need to be more tailored to individual needs for a protection against PTS symptoms. Individuals with elevated depressive and PTS symptoms might have impaired abilities or opportunities to access social support after stressful event exposure. Future studies could investigate distressing social emotions and associated maladaptive social cognitions as possible mechanisms in the association between symptoms and lower perceived social support. Especially with respect to PTS symptoms, future studies could focus on conditions that enable individuals to benefit from social support.",
