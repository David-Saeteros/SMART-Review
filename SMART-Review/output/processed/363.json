    "Abstract": "ObjectiveWe investigated the change in anxiety and depression in a general population cohort over the first year of COVID-19 pandemic in relation to work characteristics and mental health support.MethodsWe administered questionnaires to a convenience sample in Greater Philadelphia, in summer of 2020 and a year later. With more than 60% response rate, 461 people had repeated measurements.ResultsAnxiety declined but depression increased in the cohort after a year of COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived increase in support from family and trade unions, stable employment, and professional mental health support were protective. Depression scores worsened mostly in healthcare, higher education, and manufacturing industries.ConclusionsWe observed that while anxiety dissipated over the first year of COVID-19 pandemic, depression worsened, perhaps more so in some industries and where mental health support faltered over time.",
