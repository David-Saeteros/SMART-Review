    "Abstract": "Since the pandemic, an increasing number of employees have been working partially or fully remotely, or in person according to the wishes or guidelines set by their employers. This study explores (1) the links between the adoption of these hybrid modes of work (a significant change in work organization that has altered, among other things, locations, hours, and workload) and various forms of hostile behavior among staff, and (2) ways to prevent and counter the emergence of hostile behaviour in a hybrid work environment that is set to intensify.Our literature review and the results of our expert interviews show that hybrid work patterns, along with the increased virtualization of work relationships, have mixed impacts on hostile behaviour: they can act as an accelerator and an inhibitor depending on the factors considered. On the one hand, the increased virtualization of relationships between staff would expand the scope of cases of psychological harassment as hostile acts can continue and extend for the victim outside the physical presence of the aggressor. On the other hand, the physical distancing caused by the increased virtualization of interpersonal relationships can also reduce hostile relationships at work. However, the remote work environment clearly impacts the increase in the number of whistleblowers or complaints, as it is easier to obtain physical evidence.Our results also showcase the importance of support offered by employers and supervisors in preventing the emergence of hostile behaviour in a hybrid work context through various means: adopting or revising rules or policies, reviewing management and supervision methods, maintaining communication and clarifying expectations, monitoring and intervening in the face of incivility, conflicts, exhaustion or other problems of mental illness.",
