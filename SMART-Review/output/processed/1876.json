    "Article Title": "Predictors of treatment participation rate of substance use disorders among Whites and African Americans",
    "Abstract": "Low treatment participation impedes successful treatment completion and reduces treatment effectiveness. This study explored relationships among treatment participation rate and individuals' symptom severities and employment statuses. A sample of 106 individuals with substance use disorders was recruited for cross-sectional investigation. Individuals who were employed at baseline or had lower symptom severities of baseline alcohol, drug use, and psychiatric issues had significantly higher treatment participation rates. Service providers should pay more attention to individuals' symptom severities and employment to encourage treatment participation. Integrated interventions including vocational services and illness management and recovery intervention could be provided to reduce individuals' symptom severities and increase employability. Implications of participation in substance abuse treatment are discussed.",
