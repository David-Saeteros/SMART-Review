    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To inform reproductive and other health care providers about pre-conception evaluation, including considerations for reproductive planning, lifestyle modification, immunization status and attitudes, and psychosocial issues.OPTIONS: This counselling information can be used for patient education and planning and possible pre-conception and/or prenatal testing.OUTCOMES: This information may allow for improved risk assessment when pre-conception counselling for individual patients and their families is used. CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRE-CONCEPTION CARE (PART 2) REGARDING PRE-CONCEPTION REPRODUCTIVE PLANNING, LIFESTYLE, IMMUNIZATIONS, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES: CONSIDERATION FOR CARE STATEMENTS: For this review article, the Consideration for Care Statements use the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations strength and quality principles because they are comparable for the clinician and the patient/public user. For example, Strong for clinicians is defined as the recommendation would apply to most individuals. Formal discussion aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences. For patients/the public, Strong is defined as, we believe most people in this situation would want the recommended course of actions and only a small number would not. Quality of evidence (High, Moderate, Low) is based on the confidence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. In addition, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care key to evidence statements and grading of recommendations are included.EVIDENCE: PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Database were searched until May 2017, using appropriate key words (i.e., preconception, reproductive planning, lifestyle modification, immunization risks and benefits, psychosocial pregnancy factors/issues). Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, and national and international medical specialty societies.BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: The benefits for the patient and her family from receiving this pre-conception counseling would include an increased understanding of the relevant issues for both pre-conception and in early pregnancy as well as better pregnancy outcomes. Harm includes potential increased anxiety or psychological stress associated with the possibility of identifying maternal pregnancy risks.",
